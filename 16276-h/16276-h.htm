<h2>LIFE</h2>
<h4>OF</h4>
<h2>MRS. ISABELLA GRAHAM.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>
<h4>EARLY LIFE &mdash; RESIDENCE IN CANADA.</h4>
<p>M<font size="-1">ANKIND</font> take an interest in the history
of those who, like themselves, have encountered the trials and
discharged the duties of life. Too often, however, publicity is
given to the lives of men splendid in acts of mighty mischief, in
whom the secret exercises of the heart would not bear a scrutiny.
The memoirs are comparatively few of those engaged in the humble
and useful walks of active benevolence, where the breathings of the
soul would display a character much to be admired, and more to be
imitated.</p>
<p>As the celebrated Dr. Buchanan has observed, that if you were to
ask certain persons in Christian countries, if they had any
acquaintance with the <i>religious</i> world, they would say "they
had never heard there <i>was</i> such a world;" so, while the
external conduct of individuals is made the subject of much
critical remark, the religion of the heart, the secret source of
action, too frequently escapes unnoticed and unexplored.
<!--Page 008--><a name="P008" id="P008"></a></p>
<p>It is only when the career of life is closed, that the character
is completely established. On this account memoirs of the living
are, in few instances, read with much interest; but when the soul
has departed, and the body sleeps in dust, it may prove useful to
survivors to examine the principles which led their departed friend
to a life of honorable benevolence, and to a peaceful end.</p>
<p>Such considerations as these, and the urgent request of many
respectable individuals, have induced the preparation of the
following sketch of the life and writings of Mrs. I<font size=
"-1">SABELLA</font> G<font size="-1">RAHAM</font>, whose character
was so esteemed, and whose memory is so venerated by all who knew
her. The evident purity of motive which impelled her to activity in
deeds of benevolence, at once commanded love and respect, which, in
her case peculiarly, was unalloyed with any risings of jealousy,
envy, or distrust.</p>
<p>Blessed with a spirit of philanthropy, with an ardent and
generous mind, a sound judgment, and an excess of that sensibility
which moulds the soul for friendship, a cultivated intellect and
rich experience, her company was eagerly sought and highly valued
by old and young. Though happily qualified to shine in the
drawing-room, her time was seldom wasted there; for such a
disposition of it would have been waste, contrasted with her usual
employments. Her steps were not seen ascending the hill, of
ambition, nor tracing the mazes of popular applause. Where the
widow and the orphan wept, where the sick and the dying moaned,
thither her footsteps hastened; and there, seen only by her
heavenly Father, she administered to their temporal wants, breathed
the voice of <!--Page 009--><a name="P009" id="P009"></a>
consolation on their ear, shed the tear of sympathy, exhibited the
truths of the gospel from the sacred volume, and poured out her
soul for them in prayer to her Saviour and her God.</p>
<p>In a few such deeds she rested not, nor was the story of them
obtruded upon others, or recorded by herself. The recollection of
past exertions was lost in her zeal to accomplish greater purposes
and greater good: her heart expanded with her experience, and her
means were too limited, the active powers of her vigorous mind too
feeble, to fulfil the abounding desires of her soul in alleviating
the miseries and increasing the comforts of the poor, the
destitute, and afflicted. To learn the latent springs of such
excellence is worthy of research; they may be all summed up in
this, <i>the religion of the heart</i>.</p>
<p>The extracts from Mrs. Graham's letters and devotional
exercises, which constitute so large a part of the following pages,
will furnish the best development of her principles; and may, with
the blessing of God, prove useful to those who read them. In all
her writings will be manifested the power of <i>faith</i>, the
efficiency of <i>grace</i>, and in them, as in her own uniform
confession, Jesus will be magnified and self will be humbled. Her
life was chiefly distinguished by her continual dependence on God,
and his unceasing faithfulness and mercy towards her.</p>
<br />
<p>I<font size="-1">SABELLA</font> M<font size="-1">ARSHALL</font>,
afterwards Mrs. Graham, was born July 29, 1742, in the shire of
Lanark, in Scotland. Her grandfather was one of the elders who
quitted the established church with the Rev. Messrs. Ralph and
Ebenezer Erskine. She was educated <!--Page 010--><a name="P010"
id="P010"></a> in the principles of the church of Scotland. Her
father and mother were both pious; indeed, her mother, whose maiden
name was Janet Hamilton, appears, from her letters yet extant, to
have possessed a mind of the same character as her daughter
afterwards exhibited.</p>
<p>Isabella was trained to an active life, as well as favored with
a superior education. Her grandfather, whose dying-bed she
assiduously attended, bequeathed her a legacy of some hundred
pounds. In the use to which she applied this money, the soundness
of her judgment was thus early manifested. She requested it might
be appropriated to the purpose of procuring a thorough
<i>education</i>. When ten years of age, she was sent to a
boarding-school taught by a lady of distinguished talents and
piety. Often has Mrs. Graham repeated to her children the maxims of
Mrs. Betty Morehead. With ardent and unwearied endeavors to attain
mental endowments, and especially moral and religious knowledge,
she attended the instructions of Mrs. Morehead for seven successive
winters. How valuable is early instruction. With the blessing of
God, it is probable that this instructress laid the foundation of
the exertions and usefulness of her pupil in after-life. How wise
and how gracious are the ways of the Lord. Knowing the path in
which he was afterwards to lead Isabella Marshall, her God was
pleased to provide her an education of a much higher kind than was
usual in those days. Who would not trust that God, who alone can be
<i>the guide of our youth</i>?</p>
<p>Her father, John Marshall, farmed a paternal estate, called the
Heads, near Hamilton. This estate <!--Page 011--><a name="P011" id=
"P011"></a> he sold, and rented the estate of Elderslie, once
the habitation of Sir William Wallace. There Isabella passed her
childhood and her youth.</p>
<p>She had no definite recollection of the period at which her
heart first <i>tasted that the Lord is gracious</i>. As far back as
she could remember, she took delight in pouring out her soul to
God. In the woods of Elderslie she selected a bush, to which she
resorted in seasons of devotion. Under this bush she believed she
was enabled to devote herself to God, through faith in her
Redeemer, before she had entered on her tenth year. To this
favorite, and to her, sacred spot, she would repair, when exposed
to temptation or perplexed with childish troubles. From thence she
caused her prayers to ascend, and there she found peace and
consolation.</p>
<p>Children cannot at too early a period seek the favor of the God
of heaven. How blessed to be reared and fed by his hand, taught by
his Spirit, and strengthened by his grace.</p>
<p>The late Rev. Dr. Witherspoon, afterwards president of Princeton
college, was at this time one of the ministers of the town of
Paisley. Isabella sat under his ministry, and at the age of
seventeen publicly professed her faith in Christ. In the year 1765
she was married to Dr. John Graham, then a practising physician in
Paisley, a gentleman of liberal education and of respectable
standing.</p>
<p>About a year after their marriage, Dr. Graham, having been
appointed surgeon to the 60th or royal American regiment, was
ordered to Canada, where that corps was stationed. Mrs. Graham
accompanied him, and a plan was digested &mdash; with how limited a
<!--Page 012--><a name="P012" id="P012"></a> knowledge of the
future will appear &mdash; for their permanent residence in
America. Dr. Graham calculated on disposing of his commission, and
purchasing a tract of land on the Mohawk river, where his
father-in-law, Mr. Marshall, was to follow him. The letter
subjoined gives the interesting incidents of their voyage, and
forms a pleasant introduction to the character of Mrs. Graham at
this period of her life.</p>
<br />
<p class="right">"Q<font size="-1">UEBEC</font>, August 29,
1767.</p>
<p>"M<font size="-1">Y DEAREST</font> P<font size=
"-1">ARENTS</font> &mdash; This is the fifth letter I have written
to you, although I know it is the first that can reach you. All the
time I was at sea I kept a letter lying by me, in hope of getting
it put on board some vessel bound for Britain; but I have met with
many disappointments. We spoke several ships, but I never could get
a letter put on board. At one time I was told the wind was too
high, at another that the ship was at too great a distance, and so
was put off till I began to understand a more substantial reason,
namely, that it would cost the captain rather too much trouble.</p>
<p>"We have now, however, got safe here, after a tedious voyage of
nine weeks, and I will give you a short account of what happened
during that time.</p>
<p>"We sailed, as you know, from Greenock, June 10. For the first
five or six days we had fine weather and fair winds, and got quite
clear of land; after this, we had nearly six weeks of most
tempestuous weather, and the wind, except for about two days,
directly against us. The gentlemen after some time began to be very
impatient; for my part I should not have cared although it had
lasted twelve months. I had left all that was dear to me behind,
except one <!--Page 013--><a name="P013" id="P013"></a> dear
friend, that one was constantly with me, and although the rest of
the company in the ship was very agreeable, yet I was the great
object of his attention, and his invention was ever on the stretch
to find amusement for me. It is not possible for me to say with
what indulgent tenderness I was treated; but though I love my
husband even to extravagance, yet my dear friends whom I left
behind have a large share of my heart. They dwell on my mind in the
daytime; and at night, when sleep lays the body aside and leaves
the soul at liberty, she on the wings of imagination makes one skip
over whole seas, and is immediately with those dear friends whose
absence she so much lamented during the day, and in an imaginary
body as truly enjoys you for the time as if really present with
you.</p>
<p>"The gentlemen on board soon found reason to be thankful for the
preservation of life, and got something very different to think of
than fret at the contrary winds. A leak sprung in the ship, which
alarmed them all so much that a consultation was held among them
whether if any ship came near they should hail it and go on board
wherever she was bound. I was perfectly unconcerned about the whole
matter, not being aware of the danger, which was kept secret from
me till we came on shore. I saw the men constantly pumping, but
thought it was what they were obliged to do in every ship. After
coming to land, on examining the ship, they found the leak to be so
large that one might put his five fingers into it; indeed, it
seemed next to a miracle that she kept above water; but every day
of our lives may convince us what dependent creatures we are. While
<!--Page 014--><a name="P014" id="P014"></a> God's merciful
providence protects us we are safe, though in the midst of apparent
danger; should he withdraw that protection but for a moment,
inevitable evils surround us, even when we think ourselves in
perfect safety.</p>
<p>"A proof of this we had in a most distressing event, which took
place about six weeks after we left Greenock. The wind was in our
favor, the day was fine, and we were all amusing ourselves on deck
in various ways, when Captain Kerr, who was standing close by us,
stumbling backwards, fell overboard. He got above water before the
ship passed him, and called to throw him a rope, but alas, no rope
was at hand, and before one was got the ship was out of his reach.
Immediately they threw over a large hen-coop, but, poor man, he
could not swim, so he soon disappeared. The boats were put out with
great expedition, and in less than a quarter of an hour he was
found. You may believe no means were left unemployed to restore
animation; but alas, the spirit had taken its final leave; it was
no longer an inhabitant of earth, not the least signs of life
appeared. The day after, being Sunday, his body was committed to
the deep, from whence it had been rescued the day before. Dr.
Graham read in public the church of England burial service. Every
one on board seemed much affected; I cannot tell you how much I
was.</p>
<p>"About eight days after, we got to the Banks of Newfoundland;
while there the fog was so dense we could not see forty yards in
any direction, and the cold was excessive, notwithstanding the
season of the year. There were a great many islands of ice floating
on the water; I saw three within twenty yards
<!--Page 015--><a name="P015" id="P015"></a> of us, much larger
than the ship. The captain said if the ship ran against any one of
them, she would be dashed to pieces. And here, again, my former
observation holds good, for sure it could not be the art of man,
either in the dark night or in the dense fog, which could protect
the ship flying before the wind, through dangers so thick on every
side of us. For several days and nights we saw neither sun nor
stars, which distressed the captain much, for he knew not where we
were, and apprehending we were near land, was afraid of running
upon some rock; so we were obliged to cruise about till the
atmosphere cleared.</p>
<p>"The sail up the river St. Lawrence is extremely pleasant. You
know how fond I have ever been of wood and water. This country, in
this respect, is quite to my taste, and could I only get half a
dozen of those friends I could name settled down on either side of
us, with five hundred pounds' worth of land to give to each, I
should ask no more in this world.</p>
<p>"When we arrived, the doctor's friend Mr. Findley came on board,
took us on shore, and brought us to his elegant mansion. He begged
we would look on him as an old friend, feel perfectly at home, and
remain with him as long as we could. Give my love to my dear boys;*
you see them often, I have no doubt. Do, my dearest mamma, write me
soon, and tell me all about them and yourself; and ever believe me,
my dear parents, with the greatest affection,</p>

<!--Page 016--><a name="P016" id="P016"></a>
<p>In a letter a month, later, Mrs. Graham refers to the gay and
fashionable circles to which they were introduced in Quebec, and
mentions her visiting the beautiful falls of Montmorency; but
mourns over the low state of religion, and the prevailing
desecration of the Sabbath. She adds:</p>
<p>"I have read Doddridge's Rise and Progress. I little knew what a
treasure Mr. Ellis put into my hand when he gave me that book. I
cannot say it is my daily companion, but I can with truth say it is
often so. Let my mind be in ever so giddy and thoughtless a frame,
or ever so much busied in those amusements I am engaged in, it
makes me serious, and gives my thoughts a different turn; there is
scarce any situation the mind can be in, but it will find something
suitable there. I must not, however, make remarks on the particular
contents of it; it would occupy more paper than I have to spare. I
would have you purchase the book; I am sure you would like it; and
when you have read it, it will be matter of great satisfaction to
you that John and I have such a treasure in our possession. In it
are contained every advice you could give us, and cautions against
the temptations which, on account of youth, company, and the
country we are in, we are exposed to."</p>
<p>They were expecting to spend the winter in Quebec, but were
ordered to Montreal, where Jessie, her eldest daughter, was born,
and where Mrs. Graham received intelligence of the death of her
infant son, who had been left with her mother in Scotland. Further
orders were soon received for the doctor to join the second
battalion of his regiment at fort Niagara, <!--Page 017--><a name=
"P017" id="P017"></a> on lake Ontario; Mrs. Graham followed him,
and they continued here in garrison for four years, during which
her second and third daughters, Joanna and Isabella, were added to
her charge.</p>
<p>Under date of February 3, 1771, we find, from her own pen, the
following description of her occupations and enjoyments, in a
letter addressed to her beloved mother:</p>
<p>"My two Indian girls come on very well indeed. The eldest milked
the cows all summer; she washes and irons all the clothes for the
family, scrubs the floors, and does the most part of the kitchen
work. The young one's charge is the children, and some other little
turns when the infant is asleep. I teach them to read and to sew
when they have any spare time. As for me, I find I have enough to
do to superintend. You may be sure I help a little too, now and
then. I make and mend what is necessary for the family, for I must
be tailor, mantua-maker, and milliner.</p>
<p>"In the forenoon the doctor makes his rounds as usual. I
generally trot about till two o'clock, dress the children, order
dinner, dress myself, and twenty other things, which you know are
necessary to be looked after by the mistress of a family. After
dinner I sit down to my work, and we have always a book, which the
doctor reads when I can attend; when I cannot, he reads something
else.</p>
<p>"As I am at present the only wife in the place, we have a
regular tea-table, and now and then a little frugal supper; for the
doctor has come more into my way of thinking, and does not insist
upon cutting a figure as much as some time ago. When alone, he
<!--Page 018--><a name="P018" id="P018"></a> reads and I work,
as usual. He is seldom out, and never but when I am with him. We
are easy in our circumstances, and want for nothing that is
necessary; in short, my ever dear parents, my life is easy and
pleasant. The Lord my God make it pious and useful.</p>
<p>"Could I place myself and family in the same circumstances, and
every thing go on in the same manner, within a few miles of you, I
should be happy for life; and were it not for this hope, which my
heart is set upon, I could not be so, with all I have told you.</p>
<p>"We find the newspapers full of preparations for war; may the
Lord dispose all hearts to peace, for I hate the sound, though it
is the wish of the greatest number about me. There is no prospect
of our leaving this place for a year yet. For my part I have only
two reasons for wishing it. The first is, I should like to be in
some Christian society; the other, that I might do something
towards getting home. To return to the gay world, again I have no
ambition. My family here, and my friends at home, engross all my
attention; and when I see the one, and hear of the other being
well, I am happy. Time never hangs heavy on my hand; I can always
find employment, and amusement too, without the assistance of what
go under the name of diversions.</p>
<p>"We have lately had several visits from a great family. The
chief of the Seneca nation having a daughter not well, brought her
to the doctor to see what could be done for her; he, his squaw or
lady, and daughters breakfasted with us several times. I was kind,
and made all the court to them I could, though we could not
converse but by an interpreter. <!--Page 019--><a name="P019" id=
"P019"></a> I made the daughters some little presents, and the
doctor would not be feed. Who knows but these little services may
one day save our scalps? There have been several threatenings of an
Indian war; thank God, it seems to be quite hushed again.</p>
<p>"War with civilized nations is nothing to war with Indians. They
have no mercy, nor give any quarter to man, woman, or child: all
meet the same fate, except where they take a liking to particular
persons; those they adopt as their children, and use them as
such.</p>
<p>"The doctor joins in affectionate respects to my dear father,
and you, the boys, and all our dear friends. I am as much as ever,
and will be to my latest breath, my dear mamma, your affectionate
daughter,</p>
<p class="right">"I. G<font size="-1">RAHAM</font>."</p>
<br />
<p>Mrs. Graham always considered the time she passed at Niagara as
the happiest of her days, considered in a temporal view. The
officers of the regiment were amiable men, attached to each other,
and the ladies were united in the ties of friendship. The society
there, secluded from the world, exempt from the collision of
individual and separate interests, which often create so much
discord in large communities, and studious to promote the happiness
of each other, enjoyed that tranquillity and contentment which ever
accompany a disinterested interchange of friendly offices. But this
fort being detached from other settlements, the garrison were
deprived of ordinances and the public means of grace, and the life
of religion in the soul of Mrs. Graham sunk to a low ebb. A
conscientious observance of the Sabbath, which
<!--Page 020--><a name="P020" id="P020"></a> throughout life she
maintained, proved to her at Niagara as a remembrance and revival
of devotional exercises. She wandered on those sacred days into the
woods around Niagara, searched her Bible, communed with God and
herself, and poured out her soul in prayer to her covenant Lord.
Throughout the week, the attentions to her friends, her domestic
comfort and employments, and the amusements pursued in the
garrison, she used to confess, occupied too much of her time and of
her affections.</p>
<p>Here we behold a little society enjoying much comfort and
happiness in each other, yet falling short of that pre&euml;minent
duty and superior blessedness of glorifying, as they ought to have
done, the God of heaven, who fed them by his bounty, and offered
them a full and free salvation in the gospel of his Son. No
enjoyments nor possessions, however ample and acceptable, can crown
the soul with peace and true felicity, unless accompanied with the
fear and favor of Him who can speak pardon to the transgressor, and
<i>shed abroad his love in the hearts</i> of his children; thus
giving an earnest of spiritual and eternal blessedness along with
temporal good.</p>
<p>The commencement of the revolutionary struggle in America
rendered it necessary, in the estimation of the British government,
to order to another and very diverse scene of action the sixtieth
regiment, composed in a great measure of Americans.</p>
<p>Their destination was the island of Antigua: Dr. and Mrs. Graham
and their family, consisting of three infant daughters and two
young Indian girls, sailed from Niagara to Oswego, and from thence,
by a path through the woods, reached the Mohawk, which river
<!--Page 021--><a name="P021" id="P021"></a> they descended in
batteaux to Schenectady. Here Dr. Graham left his family, and went
to New York to complete a negotiation he had entered into for
disposing of his commission, to enable him to settle, as he
originally intended, on a tract of land which it was in his power
to purchase on the banks of the river they had just descended. The
gentleman proposing to purchase his commission, not being able to
perfect the arrangement in time, Dr. Graham found himself under the
necessity of proceeding to Antigua with the regiment. Mrs. Graham
on learning this, hurried down with her family to accompany him,
although he had left it optional with her to remain till he should
have ascertained the nature of the climate, and the probability of
his continuing in the West Indies.</p>
<p>At New York they were treated with much kindness by the late
Rev. Dr. John Rodgers and others, especially by the family of Mr.
Vanbrugh Livingston. With Mr. Livingston's daughter, the wife of
Major Brown, of the sixtieth regiment, Mrs. Graham formed a very
intimate friendship, which continued during the life of Mrs.
Brown.</p>
<p>They embarked with the regiment, November 5, 1772, for
Antigua.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>
<h4>RESIDENCE AT ANTIGUA &mdash; DR. GRAHAM'S DEATH.</h4>
<p>W<font size="-1">ITHIN</font> three weeks after their arrival at
Antigua, six companies were ordered to the island of St. Vincents
to quell an insurrection of the Caribs. The doctor accompanied
them, and Mrs. Graham was called to the pain of separation under
circumstances more trying than she had as yet experienced, as the
war with savages might expose him to the most cruel death. In these
circumstances she wrote him as follows:</p>
<br />
<p class="right">"A<font size="-1">NTIGUA</font>, January 16,
1773.</p>
<p>"M<font size="-1">Y DEAREST</font> D<font size="-1">OCTOR</font>
&mdash; This goes by Mr. W&mdash;&mdash;, who sails to-morrow; also a letter
to Captain G&mdash;&mdash;. Mr. M&mdash;&mdash; begs to be remembered to you; he has
been foot and hand to me since you left. My dearest doctor, suffer
me to put you in remembrance of what you put in the end of your
trunk the morning you left me,* and let it not lie idle. Read it as
the voice of God to your soul. My dearest love, I have been greatly
distressed for fear of your dear life; but the love I bear to your
soul is as superior to that of your body, as the value of one
surpasses the other; consequently my anxiety for its interest is
proportioned. May heaven preserve my dearest love &mdash; lead you,
guide you, direct you, so can you never go wrong &mdash; protect
and defend you, so shall you ever be safe, is the daily prayer of
your affectionate wife,</p>
<p class="note">*Doddridge's Rise and Progress of Religion in the
Soul.</p>
<p class="right">"I. G<font size="-1">RAHAM</font>.</p>
<!--Page 023--><a name="P023" id="P023"></a>
<p>"P.S. I am told that you have taken a number of prisoners. I
know not if you have any right to entail slavery on these poor
creatures. If any fall to your share, do set them at liberty."</p>
<p>On the 8th of June, Mrs. Graham wrote to her mother, expressing
her gratitude for her husband's safe return, and noticing some
gratifying indications of the calm and peaceful state of his
mind:</p>
<p>"You would be surprised to hear the doctor preach. He says we
ought to be thankful; we have hitherto been richly and bountifully
provided for; we ought not to repine, nor doubt, seeing we have the
same Providence to depend upon; that we ought not to set our hearts
upon any thing in this world; being very short-sighted, we cannot
know what is proper for us. Having done for the best, when we are
disappointed, we ought to rest satisfied that either what we wish
is not for our good, or it will in some future dispensation of
Providence be brought about another way and in a fitter time.
Indeed, my dear mamma, in some things he is a better Christian than
I am. <i>May God make him so in every thing.</i>"</p>
<p>Thus was the Lord preparing his servant for what was so soon to
follow &mdash; not his dismission from the regiment, which he so
ardently desired, but from this world and its temptations and
snares. Mrs. Graham's prayers were answered, but "by terrible
things in righteousness."</p>
<p>She added a request that her mother would receive her eldest
daughter, who, though at the early age of <i>five years</i>, she
feared would receive injurious influences from the corrupt state of
society around her, and <!--Page 024--><a name="P024" id=
"P024"></a> accordingly, not long after, sent her to Scotland;
but before her arrival, her grandmother had been called to a better
world. In reference to this event Mrs. Graham wrote to her bereaved
father as follows:</p>
<br />
<p class="right">"A<font size="-1">NTIGUA</font>, August 21,
1773.</p>
<p>"M<font size="-1">Y DEAREST</font> P<font size="-1">APA</font>
&mdash; The heart-rending tidings of my dear, my tender, my
affectionate mother's death reached me yesterday. I am so
distressed that I can scarcely write, and no wonder, for never was
there such a mother. My loss is indeed great; but O, my dear, my
afflicted father, how my heart bleeds for you. Father of mercies,
support my aged parent, and enable him to place his hopes of
happiness beyond this transitory world, and to follow the footsteps
of the dear departed saint till he joins her in glory, never, never
more to be separated.</p>
<p>"My dearest father, we may indeed mourn for ourselves; but she
is happy &mdash; that is beyond all doubt. Her delight was with God
while she was here; her closet was a Bethel; her Bible was her
heart's treasure, and His people were her loved companions. She has
now joined the innumerable company above, where she continues the
same services without human frailty, and the enjoyment heightened
beyond our highest conceptions.</p>
<p>"O then, my dear father, be comforted; let us now try to follow
her; let her Saviour now be ours, and then shall we be blest with
like consolations.</p>
<p>"My dearest father, I cannot tell you how much I feel for you;
my tears will not allow me, they flow so fast that I cannot write;
what would I give to be with you. But these are vain words.</p>
<p>"The doctor, however, fully expects that next
<!--Page 025--><a name="P025" id="P025"></a> summer will bring
him leave to go home; then, I trust, we shall be in some fixed
place of abode, and, my dear papa, you will come and live with us.
I shall feel it to be a privilege beyond what I can tell, to
perform every service you stand in need of, soothe your pains and
comfort you under the infirmities of old age.</p>
<p>"My dear, my worthy brother &mdash; how has that tender letter,
and the noble resolution he has taken, endeared him to me. It is
certainly his indispensable duty to stay with you in your present
solitary situation; such a dutiful, affectionate son must be a
great comfort to you, and he will not lose his reward.</p>
<p>"I am anxious, my dearest father, to know the particulars of my
mother's death: who attended her in her illness? was the nurse who
was with her a good woman? was she sensible? did she expect death?
and did she mention me, and leave me her blessing? My dear, dear
father, tell me all.</p>
<p>"Farewell, my beloved father; may your God and Redeemer be your
support and final portion, is the prayer of your affectionate
daughter,</p>
<p class="right">"I. G<font size="-1">RAHAM</font>."</p>
<p>In her grief for the loss of her inestimable mother, Dr. Graham
had said to her that "God might perhaps call her to a severer trial
by taking her husband also," and the warning appeared prophetic;
but her own words best describe the emotions of her bleeding
heart.</p>
<br />
<p class="center">To Miss Margaret Graham, Glasgow.</p>
<p>"M<font size="-1">Y DEAR</font> S<font size="-1">ISTER</font>
&mdash; Prepare yourself for a severe shock from an event that has
robbed me of every earthly <!--Page 026--><a name="P026" id=
"P026"></a> joy. Your amiable brother is no longer an inhabitant
of this lower world. On the seventeenth of November he was seized
with a putrid fever, which, on the twenty-second, numbered him with
the dead, and left me a thing not to be envied by the most abject
beggar that crawls from door to door. Expect not consolation from
me: I neither can give nor take it. But why say I so? <i>Yes, I
can.</i> He died as a Christian, sensible to the last, and in full
expectation of his approaching end. O, you knew not your brother's
worth; you knew him not as a husband: he was not the same as when
you knew him in his giddy years: he was to me all love, all
affection, and partial to my every fault; prudent too in providing
for his family. I had gained such an entire ascendency over his
heart as I would not have given for the crown of Britain.</p>
<p>"On Wednesday, at one o'clock, the seventeenth day of November,
1773, my dear doctor was seized with a violent fever. I sent for
his assistant, Dr. Bowie: he not being at home, Dr. Muir came, who
prescribed an emetic in the evening, and his fever having greatly
abated, it was accordingly given. In the morning Dr. Bowie thought
him so well I did not ask for any other assistance. At ten o'clock
his fever greatly increased, though not so violent as it had been
the day before. He was advised to lose a little blood, which he
did; and towards evening it again abated.</p>
<p>"I found he was not quite satisfied with what had been done for
him; at the same time he would do nothing for himself. Thursday
evening I begged Dr. Bowie to call in Dr. Warner's assistance,
notwithstanding he <!--Page 027--><a name="P027" id="P027"></a>
assured me there was not one dangerous symptom. Friday morning they
both attended, and both pronounced him in a fair way of
recovery.</p>
<p>"About three o'clock Dr. Eird came, who seemed surprised the
thing had not been done which Dr. Graham himself had been
dissatisfied for the want of the day before. Soon after the
medicine was sent; but O, my dear doctor said it was then too late.
In the evening they all again attended, and insisted there was no
danger. Saturday morning he seemed very easy, and the physicians
said he was in a fine way. The fever was gone; the decoction of
bark prescribed; and they said he would be able to-morrow to take
it in substance. I was not now the least apprehensive of danger,
and was very earnest in prayer that the Lord would sanctify his
affliction, and not suffer it to go off without leaving a sensible
effect on his mind. Nay, I even said in my heart, 'the rod is too
soon removed, it will do him no good.' Oh, that fools will still
persist to prescribe to infinite wisdom and goodness. I was soon
severely punished.</p>
<p>"About eleven he took the hiccup. I did not like it, but little
knew it was so dangerous a symptom as I afterwards understood. I
sent for Dr. Bowie, who assured me that though it was a
disagreeable symptom with other attendants, in his case it was of
no more consequence than if he or I were to take it. All that day
it was so moderate that a mouthful of any liquid stopped it, though
it always returned again: he often said it would be his death; but
I imagined the pain it gave him extorted these words from him
rather than a sense of danger, and was much pleased to hear him
often pray that the Lord would give him patience and
<!--Page 028--><a name="P028" id="P028"></a> resignation to his
blessed will, and still more to observe that he bore it with a
patience beyond what was natural to him. He was of a quick temper,
and being of a healthy constitution, was but little accustomed to
pain; but, during the whole of his severe and trying affliction, I
do not remember to have heard a murmuring word escape his lips; so
that I cannot doubt but his prayers were heard, and the grace
prayed for bestowed. In the evening the hiccup increased, and all
that night it was very severe, so that he could not bear to be any
way disturbed, nor could I possibly prevail upon him to take his
medicine, from two in the morning until ten o'clock, when the
physicians again attended and persuaded him to comply. This was
Sunday. About mid-day Dr. Warner sent some old hock, with orders
that he should take some in his drink, and now and then a little
plain. When the wine was brought in and put on the table, he asked
me what it was. I told him. He said, 'Yes, they are now come to the
last shift.'</p>
<p>"Mr. Frank Gilbert, a good man, and, I believe, a real
Christian, having come to town to preach &mdash; for he is a
Methodist minister &mdash; sent a note, kindly inquiring after him,
and intimating, if it would be agreeable to him, he would visit him
in the morning. He said, by all means, he should be very glad to
see him. I said, 'My love, you know I have great faith in the
prayers of God's people; suppose you should beg an interest in them
this afternoon?' He answered, 'My dear, do you think they will
forget me?' I said, 'I hope, my love, you are not ashamed to desire
the prayers of the people of God; it is not now a time to mind the
ridicule of the world.' He said, 'No, Bell, I care not a
<!--Page 029--><a name="P029" id="P029"></a> farthing for the
whole world, and you may make it my own request.'</p>
<p>"His disorder gained ground very fast that day, and I began to
be much alarmed; yet still I thought it would not end in death, but
though severe and dangerous, was sent in answer to my repeated,
earnest prayers to awaken in him a real concern about his eternal
interest, to set the world and its vanities in their true light,
and bring about that entire change of heart which our blessed Lord
styles the new birth, and without which, he says, we cannot enter
the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p>"It was now become very difficult for him to speak; but by the
motion of his hands and eyes, which were continually lifted up when
he had the smallest respite, I could easily see his thoughts were
fixed on the importance of his situation; besides, many sentences
and half sentences broke from his lips at different times, which
left me without a doubt. 'Farewell,' said he, 'vain world; an idle
world it is, nothing but shadows, and we keep chasing them as
children do bubbles of water, till they break, and we find them
nothing but air.'</p>
<p>"Observing this inward recollection, I seldom disturbed him. He
was perfectly acquainted with the truth, and believed it. The
doctrines of religion were often the subject of our conversation,
and in every point of faith we entirely agreed: they only wanted to
be felt and applied to the heart. I remained in silence to my dear
husband, but not to my God: I was incessant in prayer, begging and
beseeching that the Lord himself would carry on what he had so
graciously begun &mdash; that he would every way suit himself to
his necessities, and give conviction or consolation, as he
<!--Page 030--><a name="P030" id="P030"></a> saw needful; but
when he spoke I endeavored to answer him from God's own word, as I
was able or assisted. Once he exclaimed, 'Draw me, and I will run
after thee;' at another time, 'Surely thou wilt not allow thy
blessed Son to plead in vain for me, an obstinate sinner.' This was
a degree of faith, and I endeavored to strengthen it. I said, 'My
love, you know the way to the Father, through Christ, the only
Mediator. You say right, he cannot plead in vain; fly to him; cast
yourself at his feet; trust in him; hear his own invitation, 'Come
unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you
rest;' 'him that cometh unto me I will in no wise cast out.' At
another time these words broke from his lips, 'Form me, train me,
prepare me for thyself.' Here was a breathing after sanctification;
might not the promise be applied, 'I will create a clean heart, and
renew a right spirit within thee.'</p>
<p>"In the evening the physicians again attended, but could hardly
get a word from him. While they sat by the bedside I went out to
the gallery with Mrs. Grandidier; the apparent struggle she had to
conceal her distress, the compassion and sympathy in her
countenance struck me. I easily perceived she gave up hope, and, I
began to suspect, not from her own judgment alone; she advised me
to send away my children to a friend's house, and to send for a
person who was capable of assisting me, it being no longer proper
for me to be alone. Thus far I had not allowed any person to do the
least thing about him but myself, nor stirred from his bedside,
except for a few minutes, to pour out my soul into the bosom of my
God. I hardly, if ever, prayed for his recovery, being willing the
<!--Page 031--><a name="P031" id="P031"></a> rod should remain
till it effected the purpose for which it was sent, and then I
believed it would be removed &mdash; as if the Lord was to follow
exactly the rules prescribed by my weak, foolish, ignorant
heart.</p>
<p>"Hitherto I had suffered little, believing all to be the answer
to my prayers; but I had not seriously thought of parting with him.
I was now truly alarmed, and determined to know, as far as
appearances went, the worst. Accordingly I stopped Dr. Bowie on the
gallery: 'Tell me, doctor,' said I, 'what have I to expect? It is
cruel to flatter me: if you give me some warning, and prepare me, I
may perhaps be able to support it; but if you suffer it to come
upon me all at once, I shall certainly sink under the shock.' He
was silent for some time, and then replied, 'I am really at a loss
how to answer you.' I said, 'I will answer for you, there is no
hope.' He said, 'God forbid &mdash; he is in great danger; but
still there is hope; and if you value his life, be calm.' I was
composed. Strange composure; I neither cried nor complained; tears
were denied a passage; I was fixed and dumb like a statue. Can I,
or any one else, describe my situation, or what I felt at that
moment? It was urged of what consequence it was that I should be
composed, that I might be able to do my duty to him, as no one
could supply my place to his satisfaction, and perhaps even now he
might be in want of me. I returned to my post, which was, except
when doing some necessary office about him, generally on my knees
by his bedside, partly that I might not lose the least whisper that
came from his lips, and partly because it is my favorite posture
for prayer, from which I could not cease, no, not for one minute.
<!--Page 032--><a name="P032" id="P032"></a></p>
<p>"There were different medicines prescribed for that night, some
in case that others proved too strong for his stomach, others in
case of the increase of the hiccup. I found my head confused and my
memory incapable of retaining the variety of directions given. I
therefore accepted of the offer of a friend of his to sit up with
us that night, whom I begged to pay particular attention to the
directions, and to watch the proper times the medicines were to be
given. This he did with great care, and my dear doctor was very
pliable in taking them as they were offered. As for me I was so
deeply engaged with the concerns of his soul, I was unfit for any
thing else.</p>
<p>"After Dr. Bowie let me know the danger he was in, I sent a
letter to Mr. Gilbert, begging he would not delay his visit till
morning, as perhaps by that time he might not be able to speak to
him. Accordingly he came; he asked him how he did; he answered,
'Very ill;' he asked him the situation of his mind; he answered,
'Entirely resigned to the divine will;' he asked him what hopes he
had; he said, 'his hope was in the mercy of God, through Christ;'
Mr. Gilbert said, 'You have no dependence on any thing besides?' he
said, 'No, no, I have nothing else to depend upon.' Then the doctor
desired him to pray, but at the same time to be short, as he had
but short intervals from the hiccup. After prayer, Mr. Gilbert told
me it seemed difficult for him to speak, and he did not think it
would be prudent to say more; that he would call again in the
morning.</p>
<p>"Monday morning he was greatly weakened, having had little rest
all night from the severity of the hiccup. At ten o'clock the
physicians again attended; <!--Page 033--><a name="P033" id=
"P033"></a> but I could easily perceive they had but small
hopes. My doctor asked Dr. Warner if he thought it would be long
before he would be at rest, who said his pulse was still strong. He
said, 'It is a hard thing to die!" Mrs. Brannan came to spend the
day with us, one of the Methodist society, and Mr. McNab, whom my
doctor desired to pray with him, which he did. All this day he said
little, but still continued in inward prayer, as was visible by the
motions of his hands and eyes; he had many agonizing struggles, and
often exclaimed, 'Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.' 'Blessed Jesus,
come and receive me to thyself &mdash; come &mdash; come &mdash;
blessed Jesus, come!' Once, after a long struggle, he exclaimed,
'Release me, O release me, and let me fly to the bosom of my
Father!' All this time I never parted from his bedside but a few
minutes to give my soul a freer vent at the throne of grace. I
never prayed for life, but that he might be washed, sanctified, and
have all God's salvation completed in his soul, and be received
into the arms of his mercy. I also had been, and still was, very
importunate that God would give me some token, some assurance that
he would save his soul, and give him an abundant entrance into the
kingdom of his glory; and, by all that I had heard, seen, and felt,
I was now satisfied that the most merciful God had sealed his
pardon for Jesus' sake; and I found myself ready, dearly as I loved
him, to resign him into the hands of divine mercy; but still I
breathed after some further manifestation.</p>
<p>"In the evening Dr. Galloway, an old acquaintance, arrived from
the island of Dominico, and hearing of his friend's illness, came
immediately to visit him. When my doctor heard his voice only
whisper how he <!--Page 034--><a name="P034" id="P034"></a> was,
he said, 'I hear Galloway's voice,' and stretched out his hand; so
fully had he his senses to the last. Upon their feeling his pulse,
he asked if they thought he would be long in dying. Dr. Eird
replied, 'You must not talk of dying, but of living; you are
stronger than when I was here this morning, and I have seen many
worse recover. Do, do be advised, take your medicine, and try for
life.' These words brought a gleam of hope to my despairing soul,
and what had been denied me for twenty-four hours, a flood of
tears, and I was greatly relieved. I went out to the gallery and
gave a free vent to my bursting heart. I now also begged the Lord
for his life, and said in my heart, should he now be restored, how
doubly blessed would he be, healed in soul and body. I returned to
his bedside and thus addressed my beloved: 'My dearest life, the
doctors still have hopes, and we know nothing is impossible with
God. Who knows what further service he may have for you in this
world; or whether he may not give you to my prayers, and restore
you to your Bell and family? God works by means; O be persuaded to
take every thing prescribed, and pray to God for the blessing;
devote your future life to his service, and, for poor Bell's sake,
offer up a petition for life.' He did not interrupt me, but
answered, 'Disengage yourself, Bell, disengage yourself from me. I
want to lift up my soul to God, and bless him for Jesus
Christ.'</p>
<p>"Dr. Galloway was determined to stay with him all night, and see
him take his medicine. Some time after, he had a severe attack of
hiccup, and said to Dr. Galloway, 'I hope you are now convinced.'
He said, 'Of what?' My doctor said, 'That dissolution is near.'
<!--Page 035--><a name="P035" id="P035"></a> A little after, he
said, 'Who died for all?' and again repeated, 'Who died for all?' I
was forbid to speak to him, as rest was so much wanted, so I
answered, 'Christ, my love; but give up your soul to God, and try
to shut your weary eyes, and get a little rest for your body;' and
so he did, and got a little sleep. All that night he did every
thing he was desired, but would drink nothing but cold water, which
had been allowed him; the wine he would not touch. His disorder
increased so fast that Dr. Galloway, about five in the morning,
said to me, 'I may go home &mdash; I can be of no service, and I
cannot stand it.' I said, 'I suppose I need not disturb him any
more with medicine.' He said, 'No, you may give him what he calls
for.' Now, my God, all is over; I resign him up to thee. Only one
parting word &mdash; something yet I require, to assure my heart
that thou wilt receive his soul. Some time after he laid his hand
upon Mrs. Brannan's lap and made a sign to her; afterwards he made
a sign to me, who was at the back of the bed, to come round. Mrs.
Brannan thought he wanted her to retire, which she did. He looked
after her. I said, 'My love, she thinks you want to say something
to me; can you speak?' He said, 'Join &mdash; pray,' which we did.
He spoke no more for some time, only, 'Come, sweet Jesus,' and
frequently, 'Receive my spirit.' These words were given for my
sake. I cried, 'I am satisfied, Lord, and I yield him up to thee
with all my heart; thou hast given me all my asking. I will not be
longer faithless, but believing. Continue to support his departing
soul, and let the enemy find nothing in him.'</p>
<p>"The next attack of hiccup laid him back speechless, and I
believe senseless in the last parting work: he
<!--Page 036--><a name="P036" id="P036"></a> had no further
struggle, nor need of any person to support him. I therefore again
placed myself on my knees by his bedside, determined not to quit
the posture till his soul had entered its rest; but nature was worn
out, and though I swallowed hartshorn and water in great
quantities, I was so overcome that I was obliged to lie down at the
back of the bed to save me from fainting. Three hours did he
continue in this last work of the heart. I watched his last, and
delivered him up with a hearty prayer and a full assurance; but O,
how earnestly I wished to go with him! I was, for the time,
entirely insensible to my own loss: my soul pursued him into the
invisible world, and for the time cordially rejoiced with the
Spirit. I thought I saw the angel band ready to receive him, among
whom stood my dear mother, the first to bid him welcome to the
regions of bliss.</p>
<p>"I was then desired to leave the room, which I did, saying, 'My
doctor is gone. I have accompanied him to the gates of heaven: he
is safely landed; that is now not him that lies there. You, nurse,
will see it decently dressed; then I may again be permitted to take
another parting kiss.' So, embracing the precious clay, I went into
the parlor. Some friends came in to see me. My composure they could
not account for: our sincere and tender regard for each other was
too well known to allow them to impute it to indifference. My
distress at parting with him, even for a couple of months, when he
went to St. Vincent, and dejection of spirit the whole time till
his return, left them as little room to impute it to want of
sensibility: at last they imagined that I was stupefied with grief
and fatigue; but they little knew that at that hour I rejoiced;
<!--Page 037--><a name="P037" id="P037"></a> indeed I told them,
but I suppose was not believed. I was asked if I had any thing
particular to say respecting the funeral. I said, 'Nothing &mdash;
my charge is gone to rest; I would leave it to them.' It was then
proposed to bury next day at ten o'clock. I said that was very
early; they answered, by that time I would be satisfied it was not
too early.</p>
<p>"In the evening I returned to our bed-chamber to take a last
farewell of the dear remains. The countenance was so very pleasant
I thought there was even something heavenly, and could not help
saying, 'You smile upon me, my love; surely the delightful prospect
opening on the parting soul left that benign smile on its companion
the body.' I thought I could have stood and gazed for ever; but for
fear of relapsing into immoderate grief, I withdrew after a parting
embrace, and with an intention not to ask for another, lest a
change in his countenance might shake my peace; for Oh, we are
weak, and at certain times not subject to reason. I went to bed
purely to get alone, for I had little expectation of sleep; but I
was mistaken; nature was fairly overcome with watching and fatigue.
I dropped asleep, and for a few hours forgot my woes; but Oh; the
pangs I felt on my first awaking. I could not for some time believe
it true that I was indeed a widow, and that I had lost my heart's
treasure &mdash; my all I held dear on earth. It was long before
day. I was in no danger of closing my eyes again, for I was at that
time abandoned to despair, till recollection and the same
considerations which at first supported me brought me a little to
myself. I considered, I wept for one that wept no more; that all my
fears for his eternal happiness were now over,
<!--Page 038--><a name="P038" id="P038"></a> and he beyond the
reach of being lost; neither was he lost to me, but added to my
heavenly treasure, more securely mine than ever. Those snares and
temptations arising from the corrupt customs of a degenerate age,
which had so often caused my fears, could never reach him there.
The better, dearer half of myself was now secure beyond the
possibility of falling, and waiting my arrival to complete his
bliss. O happy hour, which shall also set my soul at liberty, and
unite us, never to part more.</p>
<p>"In the morning I asked the nurse if there was any alteration;
she said, no. I again returned to take another view, and was
surprised to find his color and countenance unchanged. I began to
be extremely uneasy at having consented to so early a burial. I
returned again, and again; O, how I wished to have kept him for
ever. Ten o'clock came; the company assembled; I became very
uneasy; at last I discovered it to Dr. Bowie, begged he would only
view him; how fresh the color &mdash; how every way like life. He
assured me there was not the smallest doubt but that he was gone. I
was not satisfied with this, but made them all inspect him. All
agreed in the same thing, and I was obliged to yield, and the dear
remains were ravished from my sight. What a night I passed the
night after the funeral! I had ordered our own bed to be made up,
and at the usual time retired; but in vain did I try to sleep; the
moment my senses began to lose sensibility, I was in a kind of
dream. Finding myself alone, I imagined he was out at supper,
though he seldom was without me; now I thought I heard his foot on
the stairs, and started up to listen if it were he, and to bid him
welcome, when my <!--Page 039--><a name="P039" id="P039"></a>
roused senses told me what I could still hardly credit, that I had
no husband to expect, and threw me into a fresh agony, which kept
me awake till I had in some measure again reconciled myself to my
solitary situation. But having only slept a few hours since my dear
doctor was taken ill, I no sooner got my mind a little composed,
than sleep again began to overpower my senses, when the same, or a
similar imagination roused me.</p>
<p>"The morning came. When I was called down to breakfast, the
sight of his empty seat distracted me. I returned to my room,
though I thought it my duty to take some nourishment. I had it
brought to me. Alas, I could nowhere turn my eyes but the sight was
connected with this dear idea, and recalled past delights, never
more to return. Our back windows looked into the garden, on which
he had bestowed so much labor and pains, and which he was just
bringing to perfection. Here we had spent many pleasant hours
together, and indulged that freedom of conversation, the natural
consequence of an unbounded confidence. The double arbor he had
reared, and so contrived as to screen from both the south and the
western sun, bid fair, in a short time, to screen us also from
every eye. Hitherto we had been confined to morning hours, or
afternoon, when it was shaded by the house; but had often pleased
ourselves with the hours we should spend in this cool retreat, even
at noonday, while, screened from the sun's scorching rays, we might
enjoy the refreshing breeze through its leafy openings; but these
delightful prospects were now for ever at an end. I might, indeed,
there take my seat; but the tongue which everywhere
<!--Page 040--><a name="P040" id="P040"></a> charmed, was buried
in deepest silence. The company which rendered every scene pleasant
was gone, never to return: his sheep, his goats, nay, even the
poultry, were often fed from his hand: every thing served to
distract. As for my children, they were by kind friends kept for
some time out of my sight; for not only to view them fatherless
distressed me, but their thoughtless mirth and play was altogether
insupportable.</p>
<p>"I accepted an invitation from Mr. Gilbert's family to spend
some time in the country with them; for though it was impossible
for me to forget for one moment, yet, when these objects were
removed from my sight, I was more able to turn my thoughts upward,
to where my heart's treasure now is, and where I myself expect to
be. We had two men-servants, and my two Indian girls; one of the
men I dismissed, the other I left to take care of the living
creatures about the place. One of my girls I boarded where she
would be in good company, and with my children and their maid I
abandoned my solitary dwelling. I met with a very tender reception
from that worthy family. My situation here was such as I both
expected and wished, and attended with many outward circumstances
which had the probability of making it supportable. I was allowed
to be as much by myself as I chose. No one intruded on my privacy
without my consent; but one or other of the Mrs. Gilberts often
visited me in my own room, and drew from my bursting heart all its
griefs, sympathizing, soothing, and advising at the same time. They
are both women of great piety, having for many years devoted their
hearts, time, talents, and fortune to the service of
<!--Page 041--><a name="P041" id="P041"></a> God; and their two
husbands likewise, whose business it has been to instruct the
ignorant negroes without fee or reward. Had it not been for this
family, I know not where the distraction of my mind might have
ended."&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</p>
<br />
<p>Thus was Mrs. Graham, at the early age of thirty-one, left a
widow in a land of strangers. Her husband, companion, protector,
was gone: a man of superior mind, great taste, warm affection, and
domestic habits. She was left with three daughters, the eldest of
whom was not over five years of age, and expecting an increase of
her infant charge. Of temporal property she possessed very little:
she was at a distance from her father's house: the widow and the
fatherless were in a foreign land. The change in her circumstances
was as sudden as it was great.</p>
<p>That sympathizing heart with which she was accustomed to receive
and return the confidence of unbounded friendship, and thus, by
reciprocal communion, to alleviate the trials and enrich the
enjoyments of life, was chilled in death. All the pleasing plans,
all the cherished prospects of future settlement in life were cut
off in a moment. While sinking into a softened indifference to the
world, in the contemplation of her severe loss, she was, on the
other hand, roused into exertion for the sustenance and support of
her young family, whose earthly dependence was now necessarily upon
her.</p>
<p>Not satisfied with the custom of the island, in burying so soon
after life is extinct, her uneasiness became so great that her
friends judged it prudent to have her husband's grave opened, to
convince her that <!--Page 042--><a name="P042" id="P042"></a>
no symptoms of returning life had been exhibited there. The
fidelity of her heart was now as strongly marked as her tenderness.
She dressed herself in the habiliments of a widow, and determined
never to lay them aside. This she strictly adhered to, and rejected
every overture afterwards made to her of again entering into the
married state. She breathed the feelings of her heart in a little
poem, in which she dedicated herself to her God as a widow
indeed.</p>
<p>On examining into the state of her husband's affairs, she
discovered that there remained not quite two hundred pounds
sterling in his agent's hands.</p>
<p>These circumstances afforded an opportunity for the display of
the purity of Mrs. Graham's principles, and her rigid adherence to
the commandments of her God in every situation.</p>
<p>It was proposed to her, and urged with much argument, to sell
the two Indian girls, her late husband's property; but no
considerations of interest or necessity could prevail upon her thus
to dispose of immortal beings, the work of her heavenly Father's
hand. One of these girls accompanied her to Scotland, where she was
married; and the other died in Antigua, leaving an affectionate
testimony to the kindness of her dear master and mistress.</p>
<p>The surgeon's mate of the regiment was a young man whom Dr.
Graham had early taken under his patronage. The kindness of his
patron had so far favored him with a medical education, that he was
enabled to succeed him as surgeon to the regiment.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the slender finances of Mrs. Graham, feeling for
the situation of Dr. H&mdash;&mdash;, she presented to him her husband's
medical library and his <!--Page 043--><a name="P043" id=
"P043"></a> sword: a rare instance of disinterested regard for
the welfare of another.</p>
<p>This was an effort towards observing the second table of the
law, in doing which she was actuated likewise by that principle
which flows from keeping the first table also. Nor was the
friendship of Dr. and Mrs. Graham misplaced. The seeds of gratitude
were sown in an upright heart. Dr. H&mdash;&mdash;, from year to year,
manifested his sense of obligation, by remitting to the widow such
sums of money as he could afford. This was a reciprocity of kind
offices, equally honorable to the benefactors and to them who
received the benefit: an instance, alas, too rarely met with in a
selfish world.</p>
<p>It may here be remarked, in order to show how much temporal
supplies are under the direction of a special providence, that Dr.
H&mdash;&mdash;'s remittances and friendly letters were occasionally received
by Mrs. Graham until the year 1795; after this period her
circumstances were so favorably altered as to render such aid
unnecessary; and from that time she heard no more from Dr. H&mdash;&mdash;,
neither could she learn what was his subsequent history.</p>
<p>It may be profitable here to look at Mrs. Graham, contrasted
with those around her whose condition in the world was prosperous.
Many persons then in Antigua were busy and successful in the
accumulation of wealth, to the exclusion of every thought tending
to holiness, to God, and to heaven. The portion which they desired
they possessed. What then? They are since gone to another world.
The magic of the words, "my property," "an independent fortune,"
has been dispelled; and that for which they <!--Page 044--><a name=
"P044" id="P044"></a> toiled, and in which they gloried, has
since passed into a hundred hands; the illusion is vanished, and
unless they made their peace with God through the blood of the
cross, they left this world, and alas, found no heaven before them.
But amidst apparent affliction and outward distress, God was
preparing the heart of this widow, by the discipline of his
covenant, for future usefulness &mdash; to be a blessing, probably
to thousands of her race, and to enter finally on that "rest which
remaineth for the people of God."</p>
<p>Her temporal support was not, in her esteem, "an independent
fortune," but a life of dependence on the care of her heavenly
Father: she had more delight in suffering and doing his will, than
in all riches. "The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him,
and he will show them his covenant." To those who walk with God, he
will show the way in which they should go, and their experience
will assure them that he directs their paths. "Bread shall be given
them, and their water shall be sure." She passed through many
trials of a temporal nature, but she was comforted of her God
through them all; and at last was put in possession of an eternal
treasure in heaven, "where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, nor
thieves break through and steal." May this contrast be solemnly
examined, and the example of this child of God made a blessing to
many.</p>
<p>In anticipation of her approaching trial, with which her own
life might be suddenly terminated, Mrs. Graham <i>set her house in
order</i>, and wrote the two following letters: one to her friend
Mrs. Grandidier, to whom and her husband Capt. Grandidier, she
committed the charge of her family and affairs; the other
<!--Page 045--><a name="P045" id="P045"></a> to her father in
Scotland, commending her children to his protection. Her tender and
affectionate appeals to each of them in respect to their own
eternal welfare, are a beautiful specimen of that Christian
fidelity and love of the souls of men which so strongly
characterized her future life.</p>
<br />
<p class="right">"S<font size="-1">T</font>. J<font size=

<p>"M<font size="-1">Y DEAR</font> M<font size="-1">RS.</font>
G<font size="-1">RANDIDIER</font> &mdash; The long and steady
friendship which has subsisted between us, in sickness and in
health, in prosperity and adversity, ever the same, without change
or diminution, leaves me no room to doubt that it will extend to my
little family, and that you will be as ready, to the utmost of your
power, to befriend them, as you have been to the dear father
already gone, and your friend, who is, perhaps, about to
follow.</p>
<p>"If it should please God to take me away in my approaching
confinement, I leave you and Capt. Grandidier full power to dispose
of every thing in this house, and belonging to me in this island,
as you shall think most for the advantage of my little family. You
know my extreme tenderness for their dear father made me unable to
part with any of his clothes, but these can be of no consequence to
me when I shall again have joined him for whose sake I kept them;
you may therefore dispose of them, and also of my own, if you think
the avails will be of more service to the children. But I do not
choose to leave any particular directions about my trifling
effects; you will consult with other friends, and I am certain you
will act for them to the best of your judgment. It is a great
relief to my mind that I have such steady and tried friends to
leave the charge of them upon. Miss <!--Page 046--><a name="P046"
id="P046"></a> G. B&mdash;&mdash; has promised to take J&mdash;&mdash;, and it is my
desire that the others, and the infant yet unborn, if it survive,
be sent to my father, where I will leave them to be disposed of and
provided for by that God who has fed me all my life, by their
heavenly Father, who has commanded me to leave my fatherless
children upon him, that he will preserve them alive, and whose
promise I have, that he will never leave them nor forsake them.</p>
<p>"Mr. Reid will not be less kind to the offspring of his friend
when they have lost, than when they were under a mother's
protection. May the blessing of the widow and the fatherless follow
him wherever he goes, and may God recompense him a thousand-fold in
blessings spiritual and temporal. Let Diana* be sent with my
children; if there be an infant, you know a nurse must be found for
it, whatever it cost. As for Susan,* I am at a loss what to do with
her; my heart tells me I have no right to entail slavery upon her
and her offspring; I know I shall be blamed, but I am about to be
called to account by a higher power than any in this world for my
conduct, and I dare not allow her to be sold. I therefore leave it
to herself either to remain here, or if it be her desire, to
accompany the children. I beg Mr. Reid will be kind enough to allow
her a passage with the rest.</p>
<p class="note">*The two Indian girls.</p>
<p>"And now, my dear friend, as the greatest happiness I can wish
you, may that God whom I have chosen as my own portion, be yours
also; may he, by his outward providence and by the inward
operations of his Spirit on your heart, lead you to himself and
convince you of the truth. But O, my dear friend, shut
<!--Page 047--><a name="P047" id="P047"></a> not your eyes and
ears against conviction. You are not satisfied that the Bible is
indeed the word of God. Is it not worth inquiring into? What would
you think of a man who had a large fortune, and the whole depending
on proving some certain facts, and yet would not be at the pains to
inform himself? Are the interests of this world of such importance,
which in a few fleeting years we must leave and have done with for
ever, and our final state in the next, which is to fix us in
happiness or misery through the endless days of eternity, not worth
a thought? Think then, and seriously ask, 'What if it be so? What
if this be indeed the word of God given by inspiration, for the
rule of both our faith and manners, and by which we are to be
judged? What if this same God, who so kindly reveals his will to
men, has with it given the clearest evidences and strongest proofs
that it is his own word?' Think, I say, my dear friend, if it
should be so, what they deserve who either reject or neglect it
without taking the trouble to inform themselves, or to be convinced
that it either is or is not of divine authority.</p>
<p>"How many great, learned, and wise men have sifted these
evidences with the greatest care, and the deeper they entered into
the search, the more clear they appeared, even those whose lives
are entirely contrary to it, and whose interest it is to wish it
false, cannot deny. As to the various explanations of it, it is
every one's duty to read for himself, and although there may be
some parts of it too deep for every capacity, and which may perhaps
require a knowledge of the history of the times to understand, yet
the simple truths of the gospel, what we are to believe concerning
<!--Page 048--><a name="P048" id="P048"></a> God, and what
duties he requires of us, and what he forbids, are equally plain
and easy. If we can only once be satisfied that it is indeed the
word of God, set ourselves to study it with an unprejudiced mind,
with a sincere desire to know the truth and be led by it, with
earnest prayer that the same Spirit which inspired the writers
would make it plain to our hearts and understandings, that God
himself would teach us its true meaning, and save us from error, we
shall, I venture to say, be taught all necessary knowledge, and be
led in the way to eternal life, and not suffered to err: we have
God's promise that it shall be so. 'If any man will do His will, he
shall know of the doctrine whether it be of God.'</p>
<p>"Forgive me, my dear friend; the subject appears to me so
important that I know not how to have done. I love you with a true
and sincere friendship: I love your soul, and am deeply interested
in its eternal happiness. Once more I commit you to that God, who
only can lead you to himself and to true happiness; and that you
may know the truth of this from deep experience, to the eternal
joy, peace, and safety of your immortal soul, is the last prayer of
your affectionate friend, who hopes to meet and rejoice with you in
our Redeemer's kingdom.</p>

<p class="center">Mrs. Graham to her Father.</p>
<p class="right">"A<font size="-1">NTIGUA</font>, May, 1774.</p>
<p>"M<font size="-1">Y EVER-DEAR</font> F<font size=
"-1">ATHER</font> &mdash; If this ever reach you, it will be when I
have taken my final leave of this world, and received my portion
for eternity in the next, when I hope I shall have gained the
summit of my wishes, and be happy in the society of my dear
<!--Page 049--><a name="P049" id="P049"></a> husband and
much-loved mother, in the kingdom of our Redeemer.</p>
<p>"My truly orphan children I have desired to be sent to you;
though I see no visible way you have to provide for them, yet I am
perfectly easy concerning them. I leave them upon that God who has
fed me all my life, and whose tender care I have experienced in a
thousand dangers &mdash; upon their and my heavenly Father, who has
commanded me to leave my fatherless children upon him, and he will
preserve them alive. The God of providence will prepare for them a
home, and raise up friends, perhaps from a quarter neither you nor
I could expect.</p>
<p>"My only concern and prayer to God for them is, that they may be
early taught to love God and serve him &mdash; that they may fall
into such hands as will carefully instruct them in the principles
of morality and religion, and teach them the great, but too little
thought of truth, that our chief business in life is to prepare for
death. As to the polite parts of education, I look upon them as of
no consequence; they may be as good Christians, perhaps better,
without than with them; the perfection of their nature no way
depends upon them. I am equally indifferent what station of life
they may occupy, whether they swim in affluence or earn their daily
bread, if they only act their part properly, and obtain the
approbation of their God in that station wherein he in his infinite
wisdom sees fit to place them.</p>
<p>"Remember to give my love to all my dear children. I reckon all
that sprung from my dear doctor mine; and though I did not suffer a
mother's pangs for them, Heaven knows how equally I love them with
<!--Page 050--><a name="P050" id="P050"></a> those who cost me
dearer. Tell them I leave them a mother's blessing; and my last
prayers, if it please God to continue my senses, shall be for their
best interests.</p>
<p>"And now, my dear father, suffer one parting word, though from
one no way entitled to advise: this is the third loud call for you
to be also ready; according to the course of nature, you must very
shortly follow; you can have very little more to do in this world,
and therefore the smallest share of your attention is due to it.
The young, the gay, the giddy, and thoughtless hold it a wise maxim
to forget their departed friends as soon as possible; this may be
worldly, but it cannot be heavenly wisdom. To be fully and entirely
resigned to the will of God in all things, is certainly the
characteristic of a Christian; but this is perfectly consistent
with the most tender remembrance. That resignation &mdash; but
indeed it deserves not the name &mdash; which consists in
forgetfulness, in banishing thought and drowning reflection in
worldly cares and amusements, can be no grateful offering to Him
who has commanded us to have our loins girt and our lamps trimmed,
and to be always ready, for in such an hour as we think not 'the
Son of man cometh.' How often are we commanded to watch, to set our
affections on things above, to be dead to the world, to lay up
treasure for ourselves in heaven. These injunctions are
inconsistent with forgetfulness; and if it be our duty to meditate
on death and eternity, nothing more naturally leads our minds to
that subject than the recollection of departed friends, who, if
pious, are not lost, but only gone a little while before, taken
from our earthly and added to our heavenly treasure.</p>
<p>"Believe me, my dear father, to a mind abstracted
<!--Page 051--><a name="P051" id="P051"></a> from the world and
devoted to God, death, though solemn, has nothing dreadful in it;
on the contrary, to a mind rightly disposed it is rather a
desirable object. Just conceptions of God, and converse with him,
will very soon change the aspect of the king of terrors to a
welcome messenger, who comes to set open the gates of immortality,
and to usher us into the kingdom of our heavenly Father. And now
may our most gracious God grant you, through your few remaining
days, his direction and consolation; may he bestow upon you that
peace which the world can neither give nor take away; and when the
appointed time of your change shall come, may the comforts of his
Holy Spirit so cheer and refresh your soul, that you may be able,
without a doubt or a fear, to resign it into the hands of your
Redeemer.</p>
<p>"Give my love to Hugh. The sentiments expressed in his letters
bespeak him a worthy brother, and deserving of my highest esteem. I
would have written to him, but I have still some directions to
commit to writing concerning my little family, and my hour is at
hand; but tell him I will remember him in my last prayers. I charge
him not to banish the idea of his worthy and now glorified mother,
lest with that he also forget her precepts; but prepare to meet us
who are gone before; and O, that our meeting may be with joy on
both sides. It is hard for youth, in the present age, to follow our
Christian pattern. Every real Christian, every Bible Christian,
must lay his account with being branded with the name of
enthusiast; but tell him to remember that the opinion of the world
cannot alter the nature of holiness, nor the maxims of Christ. Let
him read, think, and judge for <!--Page 052--><a name="P052" id=
"P052"></a> himself with an unprejudiced mind; with a hearty
desire to know and be led by the truth; to be taught of God, and
conformed to his will in all things, and I venture to promise he
will not be suffered to err. But let him avoid disputes about
religion, they are seldom productive of any good; let him fortify
his mind against banter and ridicule, it is no small degree of
persecution. Yet, if he be determined to follow his Lord, he must
expect to meet with it, and I know from experience it is hard to
bear. I have found the safest way is to receive it in silence; for
those who are disposed to ridicule the appearance of religion in
another, are not in a fit disposition to be convinced by any
argument, at least at that time, and few can dispute without heat,
which is a transgression against the virtue of meekness, and very
apt to lessen our love to the person who opposes us. We lose the
spirit of brotherly love in hot-headed zeal, which perhaps deserves
a harder name, but conceals itself under that appearance; and it is
no small victory gained over ourselves if we are able to love, wish
well to, and be ready to serve those whose sentiments differ from
ours.</p>
<p>"I leave you and yours, and mine, upon the Fountain of all
goodness, and may the peace of God, which passeth all
understanding, keep your hearts and minds in the knowledge and love
of God, and of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord; and the blessing of
God Almighty, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, be among you, and
remain with you always.&emsp;Amen.</p>

<p>It pleased God to preserve the life of Mrs. Graham, and to make
her the grateful mother of a son, whom <!--Page 053--><a name=
"P053" id="P053"></a> she called after the name of his father,
and endeavored, in humble trust, to consecrate to the Author of his
being.</p>
<p>Having now no object to induce her to stay longer at Antigua,
she disposed of her slender property, and placing her money in the
hands of Major Brown, requested him to take a passage for herself
and family, and to lay in their sea-stores. After seeing a railing
placed around the grave of her beloved husband, that his remains
might not be disturbed until mingled with their kindred dust, she
bade adieu to her kind friends, and with a sorrowful heart turned
her face towards her native land.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>
<h4>RETURN TO SCOTLAND &mdash; SCHOOL IN EDINBURGH.</h4>
<p>N<font size="-1">O</font> ship offering at this time from
Antigua for Scotland, Mrs. Graham embarked with her family in one
bound to Belfast, Ireland. Major Brown and his brother officers saw
her safely out to sea; and he gave her a letter to a gentleman in
Belfast, containing, as he said, a bill for the balance of the
money she had deposited with him. After a stormy and trying voyage,
she arrived in safety at her destined port. The correspondent in
Ireland of Major Brown delivered her a letter from that officer
expressive of esteem and affection, and stating that as a proof of
respect for the memory of their deceased friend, he and his brother
officers had taken the liberty of defraying the expenses of her
voyage.</p>
<p>Consequently the bill he had given was for the full amount of
her original deposit; and thus, like the brethren of Joseph, <i>she
found all her money in the sack's mouth.</i> Being a stranger in
Ireland, without a friend to look out for a proper vessel in which
to embark for Scotland, she and her children went passengers in a
packet; on board of which, as she afterwards learned, there was not
even a compass. A storm arose and they were tossed to and fro for
nine hours in imminent danger. The rudder and the mast were carried
away; every thing on deck thrown overboard; and at length the
vessel struck in the night upon a rock, on the coast of Ayr, in
Scotland. The greatest confusion pervaded <!--Page 055--><a name=
"P055" id="P055"></a> the passengers and crew. Among a number of
young students, going to the University at Edinburgh, some were
swearing, some praying, and all were in despair. The widow only
remained composed. With her babe in her arms she hushed her weeping
family, and told them that in a few minutes they should all go to
join their father in a better world. The passengers wrote their
names in their pocket-books, that their bodies might be recognized
and reported for the information of their friends. One young man
came into the cabin, asking, "Is there any peace here?" He was
surprised to find a female so tranquil; a short conversation soon
evinced that religion was the source of comfort and hope to them
both in this perilous hour. He engaged in prayer and then read the
107th Psalm. While repeating these words, "he maketh the storm a
calm, so that the waves thereof are still," the vessel swung off
the rock by the rising of the tide. She had been dashing against it
for an hour and a half, the sea making a breach over her, so that
the hold was now nearly filled with water. Towards morning the
storm subsided, and the vessel floated until she rested on a
sand-bank. Assistance was afforded from the shore, and the
shipwrecked company took shelter in a small inn, where the men
seemed anxious to drown the remembrance of danger in a bowl of
punch. How faithful a monitor is conscience! This voice is listened
to in extreme peril; but O, infatuated man, how anxious art thou to
stifle the warnings of wisdom in the hour of prosperity. Thousands
of our race, no doubt, delay their preparation for eternity until,
by sudden death, they have scarcely a moment left to perform this
solemn work. <!--Page 056--><a name="P056" id="P056"></a></p>
<p>Mrs. Graham retired to a private room, to offer up thanksgiving
to God for his goodness, and to commend herself and her orphans to
his future care.</p>
<p>A gentleman from Ayr, hearing of the shipwreck, came down to
offer assistance; and in him Mrs. Graham was happy to recognize an
old friend. This gentleman paid her and her family much attention,
carrying them to his own house, and treating them with kindness and
hospitality.</p>
<p>In a day or two after this she reached Cartside, and entered her
father's dwelling; not the large ancient mansion in which she had
left him, but a thatched cottage, consisting of three apartments.
Possessed of a too easy temper and unsuspecting disposition, Mr.
Marshall had been induced to become security for some of his
friends, whose failure in business had reduced him to poverty. He
now acted as factor of a gentleman's estate in this neighborhood,
of whose father he had been the intimate friend, with a salary of
twenty pounds sterling per annum and the use of a small farm.</p>
<p>In a short time, however, his health failed, and he was deprived
of this scanty pittance, being incapable, as the proprietor was
pleased to think, of fulfilling the duties of factor.</p>
<p>Alive to every call of duty, Mrs. Graham now considered her
father as added, with her children, to the number of dependents on
her industry. She proved indeed a good daughter &mdash; faithful,
affectionate, and dutiful, she supported her father through his
declining years; and he died at her house, Feb. 13, 1783, aged 75,
during her residence in Edinburgh, surrounded by his daughter and
her children, who tenderly watched him during his last illness.
<!--Page 057--><a name="P057" id="P057"></a></p>
<p>Having resided two years at Cartside, she removed to Paisley in
1778, where she taught a small school. The slender profits of such
an establishment, with a widow's pension of sixteen pounds
sterling, were the means of subsistence for herself and her family.
When she first returned to Cartside a few religious friends called
to welcome her home. The gay and wealthy part of her former
acquaintances, who, like the butterfly, spread their silken wings
only to bask in the warmth of a summer sun, found not their way to
the lonely cottage of an afflicted widow. Her worth, though in
after-life rendered splendid by its own fruits, was at this time
hidden, excepting to those whose reflection and wisdom had taught
them to discern it more in the faith and submission of the soul,
than in the selfish and extravagant exhibitions of that wealth
bestowed by the bounty of Providence, but expended too often for
the purposes of vanity and dissipation.</p>
<p>In such circumstances, the Christian character of Mrs. Graham
was strongly marked. Sensible that her heavenly Father saw it good,
at this time, to depress her outward condition, full of filial
tenderness, and like a real child of God resigned to whatever
should appear to be his will, her conduct conformed to his
dispensations. With a cheerful heart, and in the hope of faith, she
set herself to walk down into the valley of humiliation, "leaning
upon Jesus," as the beloved of her soul. "I delight to do thy will,
O my God, yea, thy law is within my heart," was the spontaneous
effusion of her genuine faith. She received with affection the
scriptural admonition, "Humble yourselves therefore under the
mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due
<!--Page 058--><a name="P058" id="P058"></a> time; casting all
your care upon him, for he careth for you."</p>
<p>She laid aside her children's fine frocks, and clothed them in
homespun. At Cartside she sold the butter she made, and her
children were fed on the milk. It was her wish to eat her own
bread, however coarse, and to owe no person anything but love. At
Paisley, for a season, her breakfast and supper was porridge, and
her dinner potatoes and salt. Peace with God and a contented mind
supplied the lack of earthly prosperity, and she adverted to this
her humble fare, to comfort the hearts of suffering sisters, with
whom she corresponded at a later period of life, when in
comfortable circumstances.</p>
<p>Meantime the Lord was not unmindful of his believing child; but
was preparing the minds of her friends for introducing her to a
more enlarged sphere of usefulness.</p>
<p>Her pious and attached friend, Mrs. Major Brown, had accompanied
her husband to Scotland, and they now resided on their estate in
Ayrshire. Mr. Peter Reid, a kind friend when in Antigua, was now a
merchant in London. This gentleman advised her to invest the little
money she had brought home &mdash; and which she had still
preserved &mdash; in muslins; which she could work into finer
articles of dress, and he would ship them in a vessel of his
own/freight free, to be sold in the West Indies. His object was
partly to increase her little capital, and partly to divert her
mind from meditating so deeply on the loss of her lamented husband.
The plan so kindly proposed was soon adopted; the muslin dresses
were shipped; but she soon afterwards learned that the ship was
captured by the <!--Page 059--><a name="P059" id="P059"></a>
French. This was a severe loss, and more deeply felt as it was
received at the time when her father was deprived of his
office.</p>
<p>Mrs. Brown, after consulting with the Rev. Mr. Randall of
Glasgow, the Rev. Mr. Ellis of Paisley, Lady Glenorchy and Mrs.
Walker of Edinburgh, proposed to Mrs. Graham to take charge of a
boarding-school in that metropolis.</p>
<p>The friends of religion were of opinion that such an
establishment, under the direction of one possessing the
qualifications of Mrs. Graham, would be of singular benefit to
young ladies destined for important stations in society. Her
liberal education, her acquaintance with life, and her humble yet
ardent piety, were considered peculiarly calculated to qualify her
for so important a trust.</p>
<p>Another friend had suggested to Mrs. Graham the propriety of
opening a boarding-house in Edinburgh, which he thought could,
through his influence, be easily filled by students.</p>
<p>She saw obstacles to both: a boarding-house did not appear
suitable, as her daughters would not be so likely to have the same
advantages of education as from a boarding-school; and to engage as
an instructress of youth on so large a scale, with so many
competitors, appeared for her an arduous undertaking.</p>
<p>In this perplexity, as in former trials, she fled to her
unerring counsellor the Lord, her covenant God. She set apart a day
for fasting and prayer. She spread her case before the Lord,
earnestly beseeching him to make his word "a light to her feet and
a lamp to her path," and "to lead her in the way in which she
should <!--Page 060--><a name="P060" id="P060"></a> go;"
especially that she might be directed to choose the path in which
she could best promote his glory and the highest interests of
herself and her children. On searching the Scriptures, her mind
fastened on these words in John 21:15, "Simon, son of Jonas, lovest
thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest
that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs."</p>
<p>Never, perhaps, was this commandment applied with more filial
confidence, or accompanied with a richer blessing, since the days
of the apostle, than in the present instance.</p>
<p>Her determination was accordingly made. She resolved to
undertake the education of youth, trusting that her Lord would make
her an humble instrument of training some for his service on earth,
and his praises in heaven. Here was exhibited an instance of simple
yet powerful faith in a believer surrounded by temporal
perplexities, and of condescension and mercy on the part of a
compassionate God. Light unseen by mortal eyes descended on her
path.</p>
<p>How weak, perhaps enthusiastic, would this have appeared to the
busy crowd, blind to the special providence exercised by the God of
heaven towards all his creatures. She felt the pressure of her
affliction; but, like the Psalmist, <i>gave herself unto
prayer</i>:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>"Prayer ardent opens heaven, lets down a
stream<br /></span> <span>Of glory on the consecrated
hour<br /></span> <span>Of man in audience with the
Deity."<br /></span></div>
</div>
<p>Though her faith was strong, yet her mind was under such
agitation, from her total want of funds to carry her plan into
effect, and from other conflicting exercises, as to throw her into
a nervous fever, which <!--Page 061--><a name="P061" id=
"P061"></a> kept her confined to her bed for some weeks. On her
recovery, she felt it her duty to <i>go forward,</i> trusting that
He, who had directed her path, would provide the means that were
necessary to enable her to walk in it: she sold her heavy
furniture, packed up all her remaining effects, and prepared to set
out from Paisley for Edinburgh on a Monday, in the year 1779.</p>
<p>On the Saturday previous she sat by her fire musing and
wondering in what manner the Lord would appear for her at this
time, when a letter was brought to her from Mr. Peter Reid,
enclosing a sum of money which he had recovered from the
underwriters, on account of Mrs. Graham's muslins captured on their
passage to the West Indies. Mrs. Graham had considered them as
totally lost, but her friend had taken the precaution to have them
insured.</p>
<p>With this supply she was enabled to accomplish her object, and
arrived in Edinburgh with her family. Her friend Mrs. Brown met her
there, and stayed with her a few days, to comfort and patronize her
in her new undertaking. Mrs. Brown was her warm and constant friend
until her death, which occurred at Paisley in 1782, when she was
attending the communion. She bequeathed her daughter Mary to Mrs.
Graham's care. But in 1785 the daughter followed the mother, being
cut off by a fever in the twelfth year of her age.</p>
<p>It may be proper here to introduce the name of Mr. George
Anderson, a merchant in Glasgow, who had been an early and
particular friend of Dr. Graham. He kindly offered his friendly
services, and the use of his purse, to promote the welfare of the
bereaved family of his friend. Mrs. Graham occasionally
<!--Page 062--><a name="P062" id="P062"></a> drew upon both. The
money she borrowed she had the satisfaction of repaying with
interest. A correspondence was carried on between them after Mrs.
Graham's removal to America, until the death of Mr. Anderson, in
1802.</p>
<p>During her residence in Edinburgh she was honored with the
friendship and counsel of many persons of distinction and piety.
The Viscountess Glenorchy, Lady Boss Baillie, Lady Jane Belches,
Mrs. Walter Scott, mother of the poet, Mrs. Dr. Davidson, and Mrs.
Baillie Walker, were among her warm personal friends. The Rev. Dr.
Erskine, and Dr. Davidson, formerly the Rev. Mr. Randall of
Glasgow, and many respectable clergymen, were also her friends. She
and her family attended on the ministry of Dr. Davidson, an able,
evangelical, useful pastor.</p>
<p>Her school soon became respectable in numbers and character. Her
early and superior education now proved of essential service to
her. She was indefatigable in her attention to the instruction of
her pupils. While she was faithful in giving them those
accomplishments which were to qualify them for acting a
distinguished part in this world, she was also zealous in directing
their attention to that gospel by which they were instructed to
obtain an inheritance in that to come. She felt a high
responsibility, and took a deep interest in their temporal and
spiritual welfare. As "a mother in Israel," she wished to train
them up in the ways of the Lord.</p>
<p>She prayed with them morning and evening; and on the Sabbath,
which she was careful to devote to its proper use, she took great
pains to imbue their minds with the truths of religion. Nor did she
labor in <!--Page 063--><a name="P063" id="P063"></a> vain.
Although she was often heard to lament of how little use she had
been compared with her opportunities of doing good, yet when her
children, Mr. and Mrs. B. visited Scotland in 1801, they heard of
many individuals, then pious and exemplary, who dated their first
religious impressions from those seasons of early instruction which
they enjoyed under Mrs. Graham while in Edinburgh.</p>
<p>Mrs. Graham's manner in the management of youth was peculiarly
happy. While she kept them diligent in their studies, and strictly
obedient to the laws she had established, she was endeared to them
by her tenderness; and the young ladies instructed in her school
retained for her in after-life a degree of filial affection which
was expressed on many affecting occasions. This was afterwards
remarkably the case with her pupils in America. Her little republic
was completely governed by a system of equitable laws. On every
alleged offence, a court-martial, as they termed it, was held, and
the accused tried by her peers. There were no arbitrary
punishments, no sallies of capricious passion. The laws were
promulgated, and obedience was indispensable; the sentences of the
courts-martial were always approved, and had a salutary effect. In
short, there was a combination of authority, decision, and
tenderness in Mrs. Graham's government, that rendered its subjects
industrious, intelligent, circumspect, and happy. She enjoyed their
happiness; and in cases of sickness, she watched over them with
unremitting solicitude and care, sparing no expense to promote
their restoration to health.</p>
<p>A strong trait in her character was distinctly
<!--Page 064--><a name="P064" id="P064"></a> marked by her
educating the daughters of pious ministers at half price. This was
setting an example worthy of imitation. It was a conduct
conformable to scriptural precept. Said Paul, "If we have sown unto
you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your
carnal things? Do ye not know that they which minister about holy
things live of the things of the temple? Even so hath the Lord
ordained that they which preach the gospel should live by the
gospel."</p>
<p>Always conscientious in obeying the commandments of her God, she
observed them in this matter, giving, in her proportion, at least
the widow's mite.</p>
<p>By another plan, for she was ingenious in contrivances to do
good, she greatly assisted those in slender circumstances,
especially such as were of the household of faith. Believing that
the use of sums of ten, fifteen, or twenty pounds in hand would be
serviceable by way of capital to persons in a moderate business,
she was in the habit of making such advances, and taking back the
value in articles they had for sale. She charged no interest, being
amply repaid in the luxury of her own feelings, when she beheld the
benefit it produced to her humble friends. The board of her pupils
being paid in advance, she was enabled to adopt this plan with more
facility. Were her spirit more prevalent in the world, what good
might be done. The heart would be expanded, reciprocal confidence
and affection cherished; and instead of beholding worms of the dust
fighting for particles of yellow sand, we should behold a company
of affectionate brethren leaning upon and assisting each other
through the wilderness of this world. "Look not
<!--Page 065--><a name="P065" id="P065"></a> every man on his
own things," said Paul, "but every man also on the things of
others. Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of
Christ."</p>
<p>On the subject of promoting the external accomplishments of her
scholars, it became a question how far Mrs. Graham was to
countenance them in their attendance on public balls &mdash; to
what length it was proper for her to go so as to meet the received
opinions of the world in these concerns. She consulted with her
pious friends, and wrote to Lady Glenorchy on the subject. Her
ladyship's letter in reply is so excellent that the serious reader
will be gratified with its insertion.</p>

<p class="right">"B<font size="-1">ARNTON</font>, December 27,
1781.</p>
<p>"D<font size="-1">EAR</font> M<font size="-1">ADAM</font>
&mdash; I received your letter last week, and also one some time
ago from Mrs. Walker, in which she desired me to send you my
sentiments upon the alteration you had made, and still thought of
making, upon your plan.</p>
<p>"I have since endeavored to consider, with all the attention of
which I am <i>at present</i> capable, the arguments that may be
brought on both sides of the question; and with regard to the first
point, the <i>practisings</i>, I will frankly own, that could you
send your young ladies to one where <i>girls only</i> are admitted,
I should more readily yield my opinion of the matter to those
Christians who have advised you to it. But as I learn that it is a
promiscuous dance of boys and girls, I must in conscience say that
I look upon such a meeting to be as pernicious in its effects upon
the minds of young people, as balls and public assemblies on
persons of riper years. When you mentioned the subject to me first,
I thought it had been a practising <!--Page 066--><a name="P066"
id="P066"></a> of girls <i>only</i>, else I should then have
given you my sentiments fully upon that head.</p>
<p>"As to the <i>reading of plays</i>, or any part of them, to your
young people, I must own, it does not appear to me to be expedient;
it may be productive of bad consequences, and the <i>good</i>
arising from it is, at most, uncertain. It is, no doubt, very
desirable to enlarge young people's minds and improve their taste
as well as their persons; but such is the state of things in this
world, that to attain this to the degree wished for by every person
of refined taste, some things must be sacrificed of much greater
value: for example, a girl cannot acquire the smart, polished air
of a person of fashion, without imbibing too much of the spirit of
the world. <i>Vanity</i> and <i>emulation</i> must be awakened and
cultivated in the heart, before she will apply herself with
diligence to outward accomplishments; nor can her mind and taste be
much improved in <i>polite</i> literature, without losing its
relish for simple truth. I grant you, there are a few Christians in
the world who have acquired the outward accomplishments of it, and
have, by grace, been enabled to turn these to good account &mdash;
who, like the Israelites, having spoiled the Egyptians, have made
use of <i>their</i> jewels in adorning the tabernacle; but this can
never serve as an argument on your side of the question. If the
Lord sees fit to manifest his power and grace by plucking a brand
from the burning, this is no reason why children should be
initiated into the ways of sin and folly, in hopes that some time
or other he will bring them out. We are never to do evil that good
may come; and this brings the question to a short issue.</p>
<!--Page 067--><a name="P067" id="P067"></a>
<p>"Do you think it lawful for Christians to attend public places,
or to spend their time in reading plays? Do you think these things
tend, either immediately or remotely, to promote the glory of God?
If you do not, I cannot see how you, <i>as a Christian</i>, can
have any hand in introducing young ladies to the one or in giving
them a taste for the other.</p>
<p>"This, dear madam, is <i>my</i> view of the matter; but I do not
wish <i>you</i> to walk by <i>my</i> light. I believe all the
children of God are <i>taught by him</i>, and ought to follow the
dictates of their own consciences: I therefore pretend not <i>to
advise</i> you, but shall endeavor to <i>pray</i> that the great
<i>unerring</i> Counsellor may give you divine wisdom to be your
teacher, to lead you into all truth, and to keep you from every
thing inconsistent with his holy will.</p>
<p>"I have met with so many interruptions since I began this
letter, that I fear that it is hardly intelligible. I shall be
sorry if I have said any thing that gives you uneasiness; your
spirits seem low, and your business does not succeed so well as
could be wished: perhaps I ought to have employed my pen in the way
of consolation and encouragement, than by throwing in fresh matter
of perplexity. Sure I am, I do not <i>mean</i> to add affliction to
the afflicted; but rather have been impelled, from a regard to
truth, to write my real sentiments, as you desired.</p>
<p class="center">"Your friend and humble servant,</p>
<p class="right">"W. G<font size="-1">LENORCHY</font>."</p>
<p>In after-life, Mrs. Graham was of opinion that she and her
scholars had gone too far in conformity with the opinions and
manners of the world. A reference to this deviation from what she
considered a close <!--Page 068--><a name="P068" id="P068"></a>
Christian walk in life, will be frequently found in her subsequent
exercises.</p>
<p>Lady Glenorchy being in a delicate state of health, made
frequent use of Mrs. Graham as her almoner to the poor. On one of
these visits, Mrs. Graham called on a poor woman with a present of
a new gown. "I am obliged to you and her ladyship for your
kindness," said the poor woman rich in faith, "but I maun gang to
the right airth first; ye wad na hae come, gin ye had na been sent;
the Lord hath left me lately wi' but ae goon for week-day and
Sabbath, but now he has sent you wi' a Sabbath-day's goon."
Meaning, in plain English, that her thankfulness was first due to
the God of providence, who had put it into the hearts of his
children to supply the wants of this poor disciple.</p>
<p>Mrs. Graham used to repeat with pleasure an anecdote of her
friends Mr. and Mrs. Douglas. Mr. Douglas was a tallow-chandler,
and furnished candles for Lady Glenorchy's chapel. The excise-tax
was very high on making those articles, and many persons of the
trade were accustomed to defraud the revenue by one stratagem or
another. Religious principle would not permit Mr. Douglas to do so.
Mrs. Graham one evening was remarking how handsomely the chapel was
lighted. "Aye, Mrs. Graham," said Mrs. Douglas, "and it is all pure
&mdash; the light is all pure, it burns bright." It would be well
if Christians of every trade and profession were to act in like
manner; that the merchant should have no hand in unlawfully
secreting property, or encouraging perjury to accumulate gains;
that the man of great wealth should have neither usury nor the
shedding of blood by privateering to corrode
<!--Page 069--><a name="P069" id="P069"></a> his treasures; that
all should observe a just weight and a just measure in their
dealings, as in the presence of God. Let every Christian seek after
the consolation of Mrs. Douglas, that the light which refreshes him
may be pure.</p>
<p>It being stated as matter of regret, that poor people when sick
suffered greatly, although while in health their daily labor
supported them, Mrs. Graham suggested the idea of every poor person
in the neighborhood laying aside <i>one penny a week</i> to form a
fund for relieving the contributors when in sickness. Mr. Douglas
undertook the formation of such an institution. It went for a long
time under the name of "The Penny Society." It afterwards received
a more liberal patronage, has now a handsome capital, and is
called, "The Society for the Relief of the Destitute Sick."</p>
<p>In July, 1786, Mrs. Graham attended the dying bed of her friend
and patroness Lady Glenorchy: this lady had shown her friendship in
a variety of ways during her valuable life; she had one of Mrs.
Graham's daughters for some time in her family, condescended
herself to instruct her, and sent her for a year to a French
boarding-school in Rotterdam. She defrayed all her expenses while
there, and furnished her with a liberal supply of pocket-money,
that she might not see distress without the power of relieving it.
So much does a person's conduct in maturer years depend upon the
habits of early life, that it is wise to accustom young people to
feel for and to contribute in their degree to the relief of the
afflicted and the needy.</p>
<p>Lady Glenorchy was a character in whom was eminently displayed
the power of religion. Descended <!--Page 070--><a name="P070" id=
"P070"></a> from an ancient family, married to the eldest son of
the Earl of Broadalbaine, beautiful and accomplished, she was
received into the first circles of society. With her husband she
made the tour of Europe, visiting the several courts on that
continent. Yet all these things she "counted but loss for the
excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus her Lord." She became a
widow while yet in the bloom of youth. She devoted herself to the
service of the Lord, and was made singularly useful. She kept a
regular account of her income, and of the different objects to
which it was applied. She built and supported several chapels in
England, and erected one in Edinburgh, in which pious ministers of
different denominations should be admitted to preach.</p>
<p>She also built a manufactory for the employment of the poor,
where the education of children was strictly attended to: even the
porters' lodges on each side of her gate were occupied as schools
for the neighboring poor. Her pleasure-grounds were thrown open for
the accommodation of the numbers who usually come from a distance
to attend a communion-season in Scotland. In a year of scarcity the
same grounds were planted with potatoes for the supply of the poor.
She distributed with great judgment various sums of money in aid of
families who were poor, yet deserving. She never encouraged
idleness or pride, and often remarked that it was better to assist
people to do well in the sphere which Providence had assigned them,
than to attempt to raise them beyond it. There was so much wisdom
in the active application of her charities, as to render them both
efficient and extensive. She seldom was seen in these works of
beneficence; her object <!--Page 071--><a name="P071" id=
"P071"></a> was to do good: the gratitude of those on whom she
bestowed benefits was no part of her motive, or even of her
calculation. What she did she did unto God, and in obedience to his
commands; her faith and hope were in God.</p>
<p>She contributed largely to the public institutions established
at Edinburgh in her day. Of one or two of the most useful she was
the first to suggest the idea, always accompanying her
recommendation with a handsome donation to encourage the work.</p>
<p>The venerable Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge
and Piety shared largely her patronage; and at her death she
bequeathed them five thousand pounds.</p>
<p>She indulged the hope of seeing a union of exertion, among all
Christian denominations, for sending the gospel to the heathen. How
delighted would she have been with the missionary societies of
London and elsewhere, had her life been spared to behold their
extensive operations.</p>
<p>She sold her estate of Barnton that she might apply the money to
a more disinterested object than her personal accommodation, and
that her fortune might be expended with her life, "I recollect
here," said Saurin in one of his sermons, "an epitaph said to be
engraven on the tomb of Atolus of Rheims: <i>He exported his
fortune before him into heaven by his charities &mdash; he Has gone
thither to enjoy it</i>."</p>
<p>This might be truly said of Lady Glenorchy. In her manner she
discovered great dignity of character tempered with the meekness
and benevolence of the gospel. Her family was arranged with much
economy, and a strict regard to moral and religious habits. She
<!--Page 072--><a name="P072" id="P072"></a> usually supported
some promising and pious young minister as her chaplain, which
served him as an introduction to respectability in the church. With
very few exceptions, all those who entered her family as servants
were in process of time brought under religious impressions. So far
it pleased the Lord to honor her pious endeavors to render her
family one of the dwellings of the God of Jacob.</p>
<p>Mrs. Graham had the honor of attending the death-bed, and of
closing the eyes of this distinguished child of God. It had been
Lady Glenorchy's express desire that Mrs. Graham should be sent
for, if within twenty miles of her, when such attendance should be
necessary.</p>
<p>The following letter to a daughter, two months later, gives us
another illustration of the self-denial and anxiety for the
salvation of the soul, with which Mrs. Graham personally ministered
to the needy and the suffering, and how skilfully she improved
these scenes for the benefit of others.</p>
<br />
<p class="right">"E<font size="-1">DINBURGH</font>, September,

<p>"M<font size="-1">Y DEAR</font> D<font size="-1">AUGHTER</font>
&mdash; Such a scene as I have been witness to! &mdash; poor M.
B&mdash;&mdash; is gone to her last abode; her state is fixed for ever. I
attended her sick-bed for eight successive days and nights, except
perhaps for an hour that I lay down in the same room. I held by
life to the very last, because I feared she was not in a fit state
to die.</p>
<p>"She took every medicine that was prescribed for her, which I
administered with my own hand; but the time appointed to end her
mortal state had arrived, and go she must. She lived four days
after the physicians had lost all hope, and I think I never
witnessed <!--Page 073--><a name="P073" id="P073"></a> greater
distress. I watched every word with anxious care to find if any
breath of prayer was to be heard; but alas, I had no such
satisfaction. As she was insensible after the first few days, it
was not to be expected she could either think or pray.</p>
<p>"O, why will sinners resist the grace of God, and spend the
precious time given to seek and find it in thoughtless folly? What
can they do, on such a bed of distress, who have no God? Time
misspent and gone &mdash; opportunities unimproved and gone &mdash;
calls resisted never to be repeated &mdash; death hunting the soul
through every avenue of life &mdash; a dreadful, unknown, unthought
of eternity at hand &mdash; an awful Judge, and no Advocate secured
to plead. A time was when a kind Saviour was expostulating with
them: 'Why will you die?' 'Hear, and your soul shall live;' 'Ask,
and you shall receive; seek, and you shall find; knock, and it
shall be opened unto you;' 'Look unto me and be ye saved, all ye
ends of the earth;' 'Let the wicked forsake his way, and the
unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and
he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly
pardon;' 'Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters'
&mdash; blessings purchased by Christ: pardon of sin,
reconciliation with God, a new heart and spirit, all that is
necessary for time and eternity &mdash; 'He that hath no money,' no
merit, no good about him, no claim upon any account whatever,
'come, buy and eat, without money and without price;' 'Why spend ye
your money,' time, talents, affections, desires, 'for that which is
not bread,' and cannot satisfy? 'incline your ear, and come unto
me; hear, and your soul shall live, and I will make an everlasting
covenant <!--Page 074--><a name="P074" id="P074"></a> with you.
Now is the accepted time; now is the day of salvation. To-day if ye
will hear his voice, harden not your heart.'</p>
<p>"Such is the language of the dear Redeemer to sinners every day,
in his written word, from the pulpit, and in the dispensations of
his providence; but O, the madness of sinners, who will not think,
who will not attend, will not apply to this Saviour, whose sole
errand into this world was to seek and to save sinners, yea, the
very chief; but they will not put their souls into his hands, nor
give him any service. A time will come, and we are forewarned of
it, when this same inviting Saviour will say, 'Because I have
called and ye refused, stretched out my hand and no man regarded, I
also will laugh at your calamity, and will mock when your fear
cometh.'</p>
<p>"Improve this dispensation, my dear child; beg of the Lord to
search you and try you, and see that your hopes be well
grounded.</p>

<p>The following to her beloved friend Mrs. Walker, shows the
impressions made on the mind of Mrs. Graham by visiting <i>the
place of her nativity and the scene of her struggles with this
world's adversity</i>, when the hand of God was heavy upon her.</p>
<br />
<p class="right">"E<font size="-1">DINBURGH</font>, September,
1787.</p>
<p>"M<font size="-1">Y DEAR</font> M<font size="-1">ADAM</font>
&mdash; I have been on a jaunt for nearly three weeks; my school
mostly dismissed, the remainder I left with Miss S&mdash;&mdash;. Goodness
and mercy have followed me, and the Lord has taken care of my house
also in my absence. Yours was put into <!--Page 075--><a name=
"P075" id="P075"></a> my hand on my return, and brought fresh
cause of thankfulness; your observation, that we were mutually
feeding on the same allowance, continues to hold. I too have been
considering the works and doings of the Lord, and many of them have
been renewed in my memory by the scenes I have passed through.</p>
<p>"I visited the seat of my juvenile years with my dear and only
brother. There I recollected the days of my vanity, and the Lord's
patience and long-suffering; my repenting, my returning, his
pardoning, his blessing; my backslidings, his stripes and
chastisements, his restoring and recovering, yea, many and many
times. There, too, I found my old acquaintances no more; most of
them had finished their course under the sun; some I could still
clasp in the arms of faith, as united to the glorious Head, and now
singing the song of Moses and the Lamb. From the idea of others, I
was obliged to turn away and say, 'The Judge of all the earth shall
do right.'</p>
<p>"I recollected a lowly cottage, where lived a pious father,
mother, two daughters, and a son; where the voice of prayer seldom
ceased, the voice of complaint was seldom heard: not one stone
remained upon another; only the bushes which surrounded it, and the
ruins of a little garden, the seat of secret communion of each with
their God in turn; for one little earth-floored place was all their
house-convenience, and in the winter's storm their little
cow-house, built under the same humble roof, was their secret
temple. I found three had gone to glory: of the other two I could
learn no tidings; but I shall see them one day in very different
mansions. I saw others spreading like a green bay-tree, adding
field to field, <!--Page 076--><a name="P076" id="P076"></a> and
dwelling alone, servants and dependents excepted.</p>
<p>"I saw my father's cottage, in the day when the Lord pressed him
down, and the place where my dear glorified-mother poured out many
prayers for me and mine; my own retirement too, after the vanity I
had seen of human life, and when tired and sick of it, I sought to
end my days in solitude, saying, 'It is enough; here let thy
servant depart in peace, and let my children be reared in
obscurity.' Then I returned to the town where my husband had
practised as a physician, where I had been respected and tasted
largely of life's comfort. I saw the house we had lived in, and
many tender scenes passed; to this same town I had returned a
widow, helpless and poor, neglected and forgotten. I saw the house
where I had taught my little school, and earned my porridge,
potatoes, and salt; when I found myself totally neglected by some
who once thought themselves honored by my acquaintance; while
others, once shining in affluence, were now reduced to humble
dwellings.</p>
<p>"The Lord has been saying, 'Know and consider all the way by
which I have led thee, to prove thee, and try thee, to show thee
what was in thy heart, that he might do thee good in thy latter
end.' He is now saying, 'Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it
with thy might;' 'Occupy till I come.' Oh, for a thankful heart, a
loving, a zealous heart, a meek and humble heart. Oh, for diligence
and steadiness in the path of duty, a due sense of our own weakness
and inability, of the Lord's power and all-sufficiency, and firm
faith in the same. Give my love to &mdash;&mdash;, she is
<!--Page 077--><a name="P077" id="P077"></a> the Lord's: her
heavenly Father mingles her cup; not one unnecessary bitter drop
shall be put into it; bid her trust in the Lord; the time, the set
time for deliverance shall come. I can witness, with many thousands
on earth, and an innumerable company in heaven, that he is the best
of masters. I have suffered much, yet not one word of all that he
has said has failed. I expect to suffer more; but whatever bitter
draughts may yet await me, I would not give one drop of my heavenly
Father's mixing for oceans of what the world styles felicity.</p>
<p class="right">"I. G<font size="-1">RAHAM</font>."</p>
<p>Under another date she adds:</p>
<p>"When we trace the tenderness of our Daysman's conduct through
the whole of his tabernacling here below, and add to this the many
gracious words which he spoke, and to these again what were spoken
by the disciples by his authority, can we refuse to cast all our
burdens on him, and to trust him with ourselves and them? You know
how sweet it is, in the time of tumultuous distress, when the
spirit is overwhelmed, when God's mercy seems clean gone for ever,
and his promise to fail, how sweet to get even a lean upon the
Saviour; but when he, as he does at times, takes the soul out of
itself, and away from forebodings, reasonings, and suppositions, to
his own divine attributes, and gives it a believing view of its
interest in them all, in his wisdom as unerring, his power as
almighty, his goodness as boundless, his faithfulness unchanging;
when we add to these his humanity, and consider that our
High-priest was in all points tempted as we are, yet without sin,
and that he has a feeling for our infirmities; when we find him
listening to every <!--Page 078--><a name="P078" id="P078"></a>
petition &mdash; a widowed mother for her son &mdash; the centurion
for his servant &mdash; weeping with two sisters over a brother's
grave &mdash; embracing and blessing the little children whom
mothers, like you and me, pressed through the crowd, in spite of
the reprehensions of disciples, to present to him &mdash; accepting
the effusions of Magdalene's penitent heart with tender
consolation, O how near does this bring the Divinity to us, and how
sweetly may we confide in such tenderness. Oh my friend, He rests
in his love. Let us rest in our confidence. All shall be well."</p>
<p>When Dr. Witherspoon visited Scotland in the year 1785, he had
frequent conversations with Mrs. Graham on the subject of her
removal to America. She gave him at this time some reason to
calculate on her going thither as soon as her children should have
completed the course of education she had proposed for them. She
had entertained a strong partiality for America ever since her
former residence there, and had indulged a secret expectation of
returning. It was her opinion, and that of many pious people, that
America was the country where the church of Christ would
preeminently flourish. She was therefore desirous to leave her
offspring there.</p>
<p>After some correspondence with Dr. Witherspoon, and consultation
with pious friends, her plan received the approbation of the
latter; and having had an invitation from many respectable
characters in the city of New York, with assurances of patronage
and support, she arranged her affairs for quitting Edinburgh. The
Algerines being then at war with the United States, her friends
insisted on her chartering a small <!--Page 079--><a name="P079"
id="P079"></a> British vessel to carry herself and family to the
port of New York. This increased her expenses; but Providence, in
faithfulness and mercy, sent her at this time a remittance from Dr.
Henderson, the young friend of Dr. Graham, who succeeded him as
surgeon of the regiment; and a legacy of two hundred pounds
bequeathed her by Lady Glenorchy, as a mark of her regard, was now
of great use to her.</p>
<p>Thus in the month of July, 1789, Mrs. Graham once more prepared
<i>to go into a land which the Lord seemed to tell her of</i>.</p>
<p>The two following extracts from her private journal, indicate
the state of her mind and heart previous to leaving Edinburgh.</p>
<br />
<p class="right">"E<font size="-1">DINBURGH</font>, March,
1789.</p>
<p>"Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; and
let thy widows trust in me,' Jer. 49:11; the Lord's promise, which
he made to me in the days of my widowhood, and which I have made
the subject of my prayers from day to day, taking the words in a
spiritual sense. The Lord has done wonders for me and mine since
the day I was left a widow with three orphans, and the fourth not
born, in a strange land, without money, at a distance from friends;
or rather, without friends. Hitherto he has supplied all my wants,
and laid to hand every necessary and many comforts; supporting
character and credit, making a way for me through the wilderness,
pointing out my path, and settling the bounds of my habitation.</p>
<p>"For all these blessings I desire to be grateful to the God of
providence, whose is the earth and the fulness thereof; but these I
cannot take as the substance of the promise; neither have they been
the chief <!--Page 080--><a name="P080" id="P080"></a> matter of
my prayers. The salvation and the life I have wrestled for, is that
which Christ died to purchase, and lives to bestow &mdash; even
spiritual life, and salvation from sin. My God knows I have held
fast this view of the words, seeking first the kingdom of God for
my children, leaving temporals to be given or withheld, as may best
suit with the conversion and sanctification of their souls. I have
not asked for them health, beauty, riches, honor, or temporal life:
God knows what share of these consists with their better interests;
let him give or withhold accordingly. One thing I have asked of the
Lord, one thing only, and will persist in asking, trust in him for,
and for which I think I have his promise &mdash; even the life of
their and my soul. 1 Thess. 5:23, is my petition for me and mine;
verse 24, my anchor of hope, preceded by Jeremiah 49:11."</p>
<br />
<p class="right">"E<font size="-1">DINBURGH</font>, March 17,
1789.</p>
<p>"This day from the head of his own table did the Lord, by his
servant Mr. R&mdash;&mdash;, proclaim his name the I AM, and called on me to
write under what I would, for time and eternity. My soul rejoices
that God is, and that he is what he is; nothing less than himself
can content me, nothing more do I desire.</p>
<p>"This great I AM is my portion &mdash; what can I ask beside? He
hath opened my eyes to see his excellency; he hath determined my
will, to choose him for my portion. He hath arranged and set in
order a rich testament sealed by the blood of his own Son,
containing every blessing for time and for eternity. All my heart's
desire is there promised, and faith given to believe there shall be
a full performance. What have I to say then, but, Amen, do as thou
hast said? Father, glorify thy name. Thou hast said, 'Then will I
sprinkle <!--Page 081--><a name="P081" id="P081"></a> clean
water upon you, and ye shall be clean; from all your filthiness and
from all your idols will I cleanse you. A new heart also will I
give you, and a new spirit will I put within you; and I will take
away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart
of flesh; and I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to
walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments and do them.
And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers: and ye
shall be my people, and I will be your God.' Amen; Lord, do as thou
hast said. Behold, I take hold of thy covenant for myself and for
my children. It is well ordered in all things, and it is sure. My
heart accords to every part of it. Wilt thou guide us by thy
counsel while we live, and afterwards receive us to thy glory? Amen
and amen &mdash; do as thou hast said.</p>
<p>"If we forsake thy laws, and go astray; if we depart from thee
and break thy commandments, wilt thou visit our faults with rods,
and our sins with chastisements. Blessed promise; amen, Lord, do as
thou hast said: seeing thy loving-kindness is secured to us, and
thou wilt not cast us off from being thy people, nor alter that
which thou hast spoken; wilt thou keep us as the apple of thine
eye? wilt thou cover us with the shadow of thy wing? Art thou my
Husband? art thou the Father of my fatherless children? wilt thou
be the stay of these orphans, and their and my shield in a strange
land? wilt thou perfect what concerns us? wilt thou care for us?
wilt thou <i>never leave us, never forsake us</i>? in the valley of
the shadow of death shall thy rod and staff support us? What can
thy servant say but, Amen, do as thou hast said."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>
<h4>SCHOOL IN NEW YORK &mdash; DEATH OF HER PASTOR DR.&nbsp;JOHN
MASON &mdash; LAST NEWS OF HER SON.</h4>
<p>M<font size="-1">RS.</font> G<font size="-1">RAHAM</font>, after
a pleasant though tedious voyage, landed in New York on the 8th day
of September, 1789, where she and her family were received with the
greatest cordiality and confidence. The late Rev. Dr. Rodgers and
Rev. Dr. John Mason were especially kind to her. She came eminently
prepared to instruct her pupils in all the higher branches of
female education; and the favorable change effected by her
exertions was soon visible in the minds, manners, and
accomplishments of the young ladies committed to her care. She
opened her school on the 5th of October, 1789, with five scholars,
and before the end of the same month the number increased to fifty.
She not only imparted knowledge to her pupils, but also, by her
conversation and example, prepared their minds to receive it in
such a manner as to apply it to practical advantage. While she
taught them to regard external accomplishments as ornaments to the
female character, she was careful to recommend the practice of
virtue as the highest accomplishment of all, and to inculcate the
principles of religion as the only solid foundation for morality
and virtue. The annual examinations of her scholars were always
well attended, and gave great satisfaction. General Washington
while at New York honored her with his patronage. The venerable and
amiable Bishop of the Episcopal church in the state of New York,
then the Rev. Dr. Benjamin Moore, <!--Page 083--><a name="P083" id=
"P083"></a> was never once absent from those examinations. She
was sensible of his friendship, and always spoke of him in terms of
great esteem and respect.</p>
<p>She united in communion with the church under the pastoral care
of the Kev. Dr. Mason. This excellent man was her faithful friend
and wise counsellor. Under his ministry her two daughters, Joanna
and Isabella, joined the church in the year 1791. Her eldest
daughter Jessie, who had made a profession of religion in Scotland,
was married in July, 1790, to Mr. Hay Stevenson, merchant of New
York, and she became a member of the church under the care of Dr.
Rodgers, where her husband attended.</p>
<p>In the year 1791 her son, who had been left in Scotland to
complete his education, paid his mother a visit. Mrs. Graham,
considering herself as inadequate to the proper management of a
son, had at an early period of his life sent him to the care of a
friend, who had promised to pay due attention to his morals and
education. The boy had a warm affectionate heart, but possessed, at
the same time, a bold and fearless spirit. Such a disposition,
under proper management, might have been formed into a noble
character; but he was neglected, and left in a great measure to
himself by his first preceptor.</p>
<p>For two years of his life he was under the care of Mr. Murray,
teacher of an academy at Abercorn. He was a man truly qualified for
his station. He instructed his pupils with zeal; led even their
amusements; and to an exemplary piety added the faithful counsel of
a friend. He loved, and was therefore beloved. Under his
superintendence John Graham improved rapidly, and gained the
affections of his teacher and <!--Page 084--><a name="P084" id=
"P084"></a> companions. Happy for him had he continued in such a
suitable situation. He was removed to Edinburgh to receive a more
classical education. Being left there by his mother and sisters,
the impetuosity of his temper and a propensity for a sea-faring
life induced his friends to place him as an apprentice in the
merchant-service. He was shipwrecked on the coast of Holland, and
Mr. Gibson of Rotterdam, a friend of Mrs. Graham, took him to his
house, and enabled him to come to the United States. He remained at
New York for some months. His mother deemed it his duty to return
to Scotland to complete his time of service. He evidently inclined
to the profession of a sailor; she therefore fitted him out
handsomely, and he embarked for Greenock in the same ship with Mr.
John M. Mason, the only son of Dr. John Mason, who went to attend
the theological lectures at the Divinity Hall in Edinburgh.</p>
<p>The following extract shows the anguish of Mrs. Graham's mind in
parting with her son, and how she cast him upon the covenant mercy
of her God, placing a blank, as to temporal things, in her Lord's
hand, but holding on with a fervent faith and hope to the promise
of spiritual life.</p>
<br />
<p class="right">"N<font size="-1">EW</font> Y<font size=
"-1">ORK</font>, May 20, 1791.</p>
<p>"This day my only son left me in bitter wringings of heart: he
is again launched on the ocean, God's ocean. The Lord saved him
from shipwreck, brought him to my home, and allowed me once more to
indulge the yearning of my heart over him. Short has been the time
he has been with me, and ill have I improved it: he is gone from my
sight, and my heart bursts with tumultuous grief. Lord, have mercy
on the <!--Page 085--><a name="P085" id="P085"></a> widow's son
&mdash; 'the only son of his mother, and she a widow,'</p>
<p>"I ask nothing in all this world for him: I repeat my petition
&mdash; save his soul alive; give him salvation from sin. It is not
the danger of the seas that distresses me; it is not the hardships
he must undergo; it is not the dread of never seeing him more in
this world: it is because I cannot discern the fulfilment of the
promise in him. I discern not the new birth nor its fruits, but
every symptom of captivity to Satan, the world, and self-will.
This, O this is what distresses me: and in connection with this,
his being shut out from ordinances, at a distance from Christians;
and shut up with those who forget God, profane his name, and break
his Sabbaths.</p>
<p>"O Lord, many wonders hast thou shown me; thy ways of dealing
with me and mine have not been common; add this wonder to the rest:
call, convert, regenerate, and establish a sailor in the faith.
Lord, all things are possible with thee: glorify thy Son, and
extend his kingdom by sea and land; take the prey from the strong.
I roll him over upon thee. Many friends try to comfort me;
miserable comforters are they all. Thou art the God of consolation;
only confirm to me thy gracious word, on which thou causedst me to
hope in the day when thou saidst to me, 'Leave thy fatherless
children, I will preserve them alive.' Only let this life be a
spiritual life, and I put a blank in thy hand as to all temporal
things. 'I wait for thy salvation.'&emsp;Amen."</p>
<p>Three months afterwards she learned that a press-gang had
boarded the ship in which her son was, and <!--Page 086--><a name=
"P086" id="P086"></a> although he was saved from their grasp by
a stratagem of the passengers, yet all his effects were taken away
from him. In the following reflections on this event, the anxious
mother shows that she would not withdraw the blank she had put into
her Redeemer's hands.</p>
<br />
<p class="right">"N<font size="-1">EW</font> Y<font size=
"-1">ORK</font>, August 18, 1791.</p>
<p>"Thus far the Lord hath tried me, and kept me to my choice. This
night I have tidings, through a letter to Dr. Mason, that my son
has been seized by the press-gang. Through God's help, he escaped;
but all his assortment of necessaries that his sisters and I made
up with so much care, labor, and expense, they have carried off,
and he is once more left naked. Satan and a corrupt heart unite in
tempting me to complain. Dare I utter a word or harbor a murmuring
thought? Would I withdraw the blank I have put into the Redeemer's
hand? Has he not hitherto done all things well? Have not my own
afflictions been my greatest blessings? Have not I asked for my
children their mother's portion? Has not God chiefly made use of
afflictions as means of hedging me in, and shutting me up to my
choice of this portion, as well as showing me that He is a
sufficient portion without any other? When matters have been at the
worst with me as to this world, my triumphs in God have been
highest, and prospects for eternity brightest.</p>
<p>"Has the Lord given me in some measure victory over the world?
Do its honors, riches, and gaudy splendor appear to me empty and
vain, and not worth an anxious thought? Does provision of food and
raiment by the way through this wilderness seem all that
<!--Page 087--><a name="P087" id="P087"></a> is necessary? and
is it my wish, as well as form of prayer, that the Lord may give
that in kind and degree which he sees fittest for me? And shall I
covet that for my child which I despise for myself? Alas, Lord, it
is because he feeds not on better things, and sometimes I fear he
has no better portion. Still, still foolish. Was it when I was
full, or when in want, that I returned to my heavenly Father? Do I
desire, have I asked and persisted in asking for my children,
salvation from sin and self? Do I anxiously wish them to reach and
to surpass my present measure of submission and resignation to thy
will &mdash; to enjoy God in all things, and nothing without him?
And shall I, dare I complain when I see the Lord making use of the
same means which first brought me to myself, and recovered me also
from numberless backslidings since I first tasted the blessedness
of his chosen?</p>
<p>"Lord, I renew my blank. I afresh roll them all over upon thee.
I will try to look on, in the faith that all things shall work
together for good to their souls, and that I shall yet see the day,
or if I see it not, that it will come, when they shall bow at thy
footstool, sink into the open arms of thy mercy in Christ, melted
down in holy, humble, acquiescing, cordial submission to thy
severest dealings with them; when thou shalt put a new song into
their mouths, and they shall sing as I do now, It hath been very
good for me that I have been afflicted. I wait for thy
salvation.&emsp;Amen."</p>
<p>Again we mark her trust in God in the more common events of
life, and her gratitude in the reception of blessings from his
hand.</p>
<br />
<!--Page 088--><a name="P088" id="P088"></a>
<p class="right">"N<font size="-1">EW</font> Y<font size=
"-1">ORK</font>, September, 1791.</p>
<p>"Many have been my burdens of late; strangers laid upon me to
provide for, even when I thought I had not sufficient to give to
all their due and provide for my own family. But what is that to
me? the Lord increases business, lays more largely to hand, bears
me and my burdens, provides for me and strangers. Lord, it is all
well: give when thou wilt, and call for it again when and for what
purpose thou wilt; it is thine own. I am thine, and all that thou
givest me is thine; the world calls it mine, but I call it thine.
If it be thy will, lead me in a plain path, or if thou lead me by a
way which I know not, hold up my goings, so shall I be in peace and
safety still.&emsp;Amen."</p>
<br />
<p class="right">"N<font size="-1">EW</font> Y<font size=
"-1">ORK</font>, October 10, 1791.</p>
<p>"This day did the Lord's sent servant, in a solemn manner, take
us all to witness, and call in the witness of angels, that we had
once more avouched ourselves to be the Lord's, and that once more
Christ and his salvation had been offered to all within the walls.
This same day, for the second time, have my two daughters sat down
at the Redeemer's table among his professing people, and, I have
reason to think, given their hearty assent to his covenant.</p>
<p>"Glory, glory, glory, to the hearer of prayer. I have cast my
fatherless children on the Lord, and he has begun to make good my
confidence. <i>One thing</i>, one only thing have I asked for them,
leaving every thing else to be bestowed or withheld as consisting
with that: I seek for my four children and myself, first of all,
<i>the kingdom of God</i>.</p>
<p>"My God from day to day adds many other comforts, and
strengthens my hopes by promising appearances,
<!--Page 089--><a name="P089" id="P089"></a> that <i>the grain
of mustard seed</i> is sown in the hearts of my three daughters.
They have joined themselves to the people of God, and I have reason
to think the Lord has ratified their surrender of themselves to
him; he has made them willing for the time, and he will hedge them
in to the choice they have made.</p>
<p>"Saturday, September, 1791, the Lord made me a grandmother,
assisted my poor weakly girl, and gave a son to her and my arms.
'There was joy that a man-child was born into the world,' and
according to that word 'she remembered no more the anguish.'</p>
<p>"Thanks be to God for this salvation; but, Lord, this is but a
small thing with thee. Look, O look on this twig from a guilty
stock; poor, helpless, feeble creature, it can do nothing for its
body, and still less for its soul. O God of <i>the spirits of all
flesh</i>, give it a plunge in <i>the blood of Jesus</i> &mdash;
cleanse, O cleanse him from original sin, and now, even now, in thy
own sovereign and mysterious way, sow <i>the grain of mustard
seed</i> in his soul."</p>
<p>In the spring of 1792, Mrs. Graham and her family were called to
a severe trial by the translation of their beloved pastor, Dr.
Mason, to a better world. A few months before his decease, while
preaching to his people, his recollection failed, his sermon was
gone from his mind, and he sat down in his pulpit unable to
proceed. After a short pause, he arose and addressed his people in
a pious and affectionate strain; he considered this event as a call
from his heavenly Master to expect a speedy dismission from the
earth, and solemnly admonished them also to be prepared
<!--Page 090--><a name="P090" id="P090"></a> for the will of
God. His people, who loved him, were affected to tears. An illness
soon followed, which terminated in the death of the body. He
departed on the night when Mrs. Graham took her turn of watching
with him, and she closed his eyes, which she always accounted a
privilege and honor bestowed upon her by her divine Master. But
this tender and affecting scene is best described in a letter which
she wrote to her sympathizing friend Mrs. Walker, of Edinburgh.</p>
<br />
<p class="right">"N<font size="-1">EW</font> Y<font size=
"-1">ORK</font>, April, 1792, Sabbath noon.</p>
<p>"M<font size="-1">Y DEAR</font> M<font size="-1">ADAM</font>
&mdash; It is not my custom to take my pen on this day even to
write to a Christian friend, having occasion for the whole time
with my family or in secret with my God; but I cannot go to dinner,
I cannot eat, I cannot talk to my girls; my heart must bleed afresh
on the same altar upon which it has often been pierced. O, madam,
my dear Dr. Mason goes, and leaves me here alone: in all
probability his course is nearly finished, and his crown awaits
him. Five physicians now attend him closely. I have seen him often,
and he says, 'All is well, all will be well,' Of the physicians he
said, 'Yes, yes, it is very well; they are useful men in God's
hand; they may be instrumental in patching up the tabernacle a
little. If it be raised to usefulness, I am content; if not to
usefulness, I do not desire it. I feel no concern about the issue
of this; the will of the Lord be done.'</p>
<p>"I say, Amen; but Oh, I feel alone. I should need large
communications from his Master to fill up this blank. I cannot
write for weeping; now my face is so swelled I cannot go to church.
I called at his house this morning, found the doctors in the
parlor, <!--Page 091--><a name="P091" id="P091"></a> and learned
from them the worst. The bell was ringing for church. I stifled as
much as possible my grief; would fain have come home to give it
vent, but durst not be absent from the house of God. I heard a
stranger in Dr. Rodgers' church; our doors are closed; his text
was, 'Henceforth I call you not servants, but friends;' he ran the
parallel between human friendship and that subsisting between
Christ and his disciples. I ought to be comforted, nay, I am
comforted.</p>
<p>"The Bible lies open before me; it is full of consolation; but
all is in prospect. I look at God, what he is in himself, what he
is to his people <i>now</i> and what he will be to <i>eternity</i>:
the consolations of hope are mine; but for the present, I feel like
the sparrow on the house-top, or like a pelican in the wilderness;
and when I think on my years and the robustness of my constitution,
and that I may have a long journey before me, I am not able to look
at it. At the same time, when I consider my children, who, having
lost their pastor, who bore them on his heart to the throne of
grace, have double need of a mother, I dare not indulge a wish, far
less put up a petition for release. O, that I could get under the
influence of that spirit which I have witnessed in my dear pastor
&mdash; that entire confidence in God &mdash; that perfect
resignation to his will &mdash; that complacency in all he has
done, is doing, or will do &mdash; that rest in God, of which he
seems to be put in possession even now, while his breast is
laboring and heaving like a broken bellows, and he cannot fetch one
full breath. O, what cannot God effect.</p>
<p>"S<font size="-1">UNDAY</font> E<font size="-1">VENING</font>. I
have again seen my dear pastor, and discern the clay dissolving
fast. The words of dying saints are precious, and his are few. He
thus <!--Page 092--><a name="P092" id="P092"></a> accosted me:
'I am just waiting the will of God; for the present I seem a
useless blank in his hand; I can say very little; be not too
anxious for my life, but transfer your care to the church; my life
or death is but a trifle; if the Lord have any use for me, it is
easy for him to raise me up still; and if he do, it will be
agreeable to observe his hand distinct from men; if he should not,
you will all be cared for; leave all to him and seek his glory.' He
could say no more, nor will I to-night, but address myself to our
Lord on his behalf, yours, my own, and our dear concerns.</p>
<p>"Several days have elapsed since I last wrote; our dear doctor
still lives, often recruits, and again is reduced; but man can do
no more; my last page, before the vessel sails, shall be of
him.</p>
<p>"As to myself and family, we are as the Lord would have it with
us, and I make no doubt as we need. Business very full; a house
full of boarders, and about sixty scholars. I begin to feel the
effects of fatigue or age, I know not which. The almond-tree
flourishes; those that look out at the windows begin to be
darkened; but the keepers of the house stand firm, and all the
wheels and springs discharge their office, though more heavily;
there is no judging of my days by present appearances. Well, let me
once more return to my rest &mdash; <i>God</i>; commit my way to
him, who shall bring to pass what is best, and in the end shall
complete my happiness.</p>
<p>"A<font size="-1">PRIL</font> 23, M<font size="-1">ONDAY</font>.
It is finished. My dear minister's bitter draught is over. On
Thursday, the 19th of this month, a quarter before ten o'clock,
<font size="-1">A.M.</font>, the Lord received his spirit and laid
his weary flesh to rest. He had a sore conflict with the king of
terrors, <!--Page 093--><a name="P093" id="P093"></a> who seemed
allowed to revel through every part of his mortal frame: his legs
were mortified to his knees; he had not been able to lie down for
four weeks, and died in his chair. Like his Master, he groaned, but
never complained: he had a draught of his Master's cup, but the
bitter ingredient <i>desertion</i> made no part of it. I had the
honor to close his dear eyes, and to shut those dear lips from
whence so many precious truths have proceeded, and to mix with the
ministering spirits who attended to hail the released. This honor I
had desired, but did not reckon myself worthy, and hardly hoped for
it; but the Lord saw the wish, though never formed into a petition,
and indulged me. I bless him for it. And now, farewell human
friendships; let me gird up the loins of my mind, and run with
patience the little further, looking unto Jesus, and following also
him my pastor, 'who, through faith and patience, now inherits the
promises.'</p>
<p>"This is a great work finished. Dr. Mason was 'a city set on a
hill.' He was with the army during all the war after the evacuation
of New York; had great influence over the soldiers; preached the
gospel of peace uniformly, but never meddled with politics, though
he was fully capable. In every situation the Lord supported him in
uniformity and consistency of character, and carried him through
without a single spot or stain. Glory to God in the highest for
this repeated proof of his faithfulness. 'Mark the perfect man, and
behold the upright, for the end of that man is peace.'</p>
<p class="right">"I. G<font size="-1">RAHAM</font>."</p>
<p>Great was the grief of Dr. Mason's congregation on his removal.
In him, to great learning were united <!--Page 094--><a name="P094"
id="P094"></a> meekness, prudence, diligence, and knowledge of
the world, and an affectionate superintendence of the interests,
spiritual and temporal, of his flock. He so arranged his avocations
and studies in regard to time, that he had always a few hours in
the afternoon to devote to visiting the families of his
congregation. So regular was the order he observed, that Mrs.
Graham and her family knew when to calculate on seeing him, and
always expected him with the anticipation of profit and pleasure.
Once every week they were sure of seeing him, if in health. His
visits were short, his conversation serious, awakening,
instructive, and affectionate. He inquired about their temporal
affairs, and in cases of difficulty gave them his best advice. His
counsels were salutary; his knowledge of the world and his
discrimination of character rendered him well qualified to advise.
In one of his visits to Mrs. Graham she mentioned to him the want
of good servants as one of her trials. "Mrs. Graham," said he,
"have you ever prayed to the Lord to provide good servants for you?
Nothing which interests our comfort is too minute for the care of
our heavenly Father."</p>
<p>To one of her daughters, who felt a strong inclination to
profess her faith in Christ by joining the communion of his church,
but yet was afraid that her heart was not sufficiently engaged for
the service of God, Dr. Mason proposed the following question:
"If," said he, "the world, with all its wealth, pleasures, and
power, were placed in one scale, and Christ alone in the other,
which would your heart freely choose as a portion?" On her replying
there would be no hesitation as to her choice of Christ, he gave
her encouragement <!--Page 095--><a name="P095" id="P095"></a>
to profess her faith, although it might not at present amount to
the full assurance of hope.</p>
<p>He was indeed a faithful shepherd of his flock, and his people
mourned for him as for an affectionate father. It is much to be
desired that his example were more followed by Christian pastors.
To preach with eloquence and acceptance is a talent of great value
in a minister of the gospel; this makes him respected, and his
congregation admire him, because, for one reason, they are proud of
him; but to gain their affections, to make a congregation the
children of an aged pastor, or the friends and brethren of a
younger one, let the minister visit the families of his people;
this will seal on their hearts the regard which their
understandings had already dictated.</p>
<p>Very few ministers have been more remarkable for a strict
attention to this duty, than the late Dr. John Mason and his
venerable and attached friend Dr. Rodgers. When the former died,
the latter exclaimed, "I feel as if I had lost a right arm."</p>
<p>The congregation, bereaved of their pastor, wrote immediately to
his son, the late Rev. Dr. John Mitchell Mason, to hasten his
return from Edinburgh to New York; and after preaching to them with
great acceptance for several months, he was ordained and installed
pastor of the church in April, 1793. Mrs. Graham entertained for
him the most affectionate attachment, and this attachment was
reciprocal.</p>
<p>At this date we find some of Mrs. Graham's delightful devotional
exercises.</p>
<br />
<p class="right">"N<font size="-1">EW</font> Y<font size=
"-1">ORK</font>, 1793.</p>
<p>"Blessed Lord, thou hast, to the praise of thy grace, given me
the heritage of them that fear thy name; <!--Page 096--><a name=
"P096" id="P096"></a> thou hast prepared my heart to pray, and
inclined thine ear to hear; thou hast drawn me into thy fold, and
hast fed me in thy green pastures. I rejoice in Israel's Shepherd;
not one of his flock shall be lost. Often have I wandered from his
presence and sought pasture among the swine, but my Shepherd has
ever drawn or driven me back. He has a rod and I have felt it; but
I bless the hand and kiss the rod.</p>
<p>"O, how wonderful to look back and see 'all the way by which he
has led me, to prove me, to try me, to show me what was in my
heart, that he might do me good at my latter end.' Amen, my God, I
leave myself in thy hands. I should lose myself; but thou wilt keep
me from foes without and foes within. What then have I to care for?
My Shepherd careth for all; he slumbers not nor sleeps, and he will
perfect what concerns me; of this I am as sure as that I now write
it.</p>
<p>"The law of thy mouth is better unto me than gold and silver. O
how I love thy law, it is my meditation all the day. Thou, through
thy commandments &mdash; or the whole of thy truth &mdash; hast
made me wiser than my teachers. The law of God makes the simple
wise. How sweet are thy words unto my taste, yea, sweeter than
honey to my mouth. Through thy precepts I get understanding,
therefore I hate every false way. 'Thy word is a lamp unto my feet,
and a light unto my path.' How safe, how happy are they who are
taught by the word of God. 'Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona, for
flesh and blood hath not taught thee this, but my Father who is in
heaven.'</p>
<p>"O my children, enrich your minds with a full acquaintance with
the word of God; lay it up in your <!--Page 097--><a name="P097"
id="P097"></a> memories, when you can do nothing more; be
assured, if ever you are made wise unto salvation, it must be by
this word; if ever you are taught of God, he will teach you by the
words contained in the Bible. 'Search the Scriptures, for they are
they which testify of me;' search the Scriptures, for in them are
contained the words of eternal life. 'Be followers of them who,
through faith and patience, now inherit the promises.'</p>
<p>"Holy David went forward, heavenward, improving in the knowledge
of God, of himself, and of God's plan of salvation for ruined
sinners, by studying the word, the works, and the providences of
God, but chiefly the word of God; praying for, watching for the
influences of God's Spirit on his judgment and thinking powers: it
was by this that he became wiser than his teachers. He was a king,
and had the cares of the nation to occupy his mind; he was a man of
war, and had that art to study. But O, the privilege of the
Christian! he goes through every part, even of his earthly way,
leaning upon God. David could say, even of war, 'The Lord teaches
my hands to war, and my fingers to fight.' 'The Lord subdued the
people under me.' In temporals and in spirituals, he is my shield,
my strength, my buckler, my strong tower.' I shall not fear what
man can do unto me.' 'In Judah's land God is well known; there he
brake the spear, the bow, and the battle.' He ascribes all to God.
We hear nothing of his own wisdom, his disciplined armies, his
order of battle and warlike powers, though attention to all these
was his duty, and not neglected by him. He devoted all his natural
talents to God; he exercised them diligently, but still he knew and
acted under the influence of that knowledge, that
<!--Page 098--><a name="P098" id="P098"></a> unless the Lord
build the house, the builders lose their pains; unless the Lord
keep the city, the watchmen watch in vain. He, as well as worldly
men, chose the means best adapted to the end proposed. Let natural
men assert, and let it be admitted, that David knew better how to
use a sling and a stone, than mail, helmet, and sword; therefore he
chose them. But follow David until he meets the hostile foe. Do we
hear a word of his art as a slinger, as a marksman? though we may
suppose he was expert at both. 'Thou comest to me with a sword, a
spear, and a shield; but I come in the name of the Lord of hosts,
the God of the armies of Israel whom thou hast defied; and this
assembly shall know that the Lord saveth not with sword and spear'
&mdash; these are not essential &mdash; 'for the battle is the
Lord's, and he will give you into our hands.'</p>
<p>"How comfortably might Christians go through life did they walk
with God in their daily business and occupations, carefully
observing the leadings of Providence, cautiously avoiding either
running before or lagging behind; but in all things making their
requests known to God; at all times committing their way to him,
being careful about nothing, but to use with diligence the means of
grace, and also the means of acquiring the good things of life,
leaving the issues of both to God, in the full assurance that what
is good the Lord will give. 'Trust in the Lord, and do good; so
shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed.' In
spirituals and in temporals, 'the hand of the diligent maketh
rich.' Be 'not slothful in business, fervent in spirit, serving the
Lord.'</p>
<p>"Lord, teach me thy law graciously, in all its perfection,
<!--Page 099--><a name="P099" id="P099"></a> its extent, order,
beauty, and harmony, and grant me all the assistance provided to
enable a lost, depraved, corrupted child of Adam, to set out in thy
good ways, to go forward, and to finish in the same course; and all
the consolation, joy, and peace which thou hast provided to be
enjoyed in a measure even here, and to be perfected in the world to
come.&emsp;Amen.</p>
<p>"'O Israel, return unto the Lord, for thou hast fallen by thine
iniquity.' Hos. 14. Yes, fallen, O how fallen from God the only
good, the fountain of happiness. Lost his image, which was the
glory of man in paradise. Lost that sweet complacency and delight
in his perfections and attributes which innocence enjoyed. Lost
rectitude of reason and judgment. No longer can we judge of
excellence, no longer love what God loves. Our wills no longer
straight with his will, but crooked, opposing God, and choosing
evil instead of good. 'O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself, but
in me is thy help.' Amen, says my soul, in thee is my help."</p>

<p>Writing about this date to her beloved friend Mrs. O&mdash;&mdash; of
Edinburgh, Mrs. Graham, for the encouragement of her friend, gives
her, in confidence, the following record of her own Christian
experience:</p>
<p>"It is now. I think, thirty-five years since I simply, but
solemnly, accepted of the Lord's Christ, as God's gift to a lost
world. I rolled my condemned, perishing, corrupted soul upon this
Jesus, exhibited in the gospel as a Saviour from sin. My views then
were dark compared with what they now are: but this I remember,
that at the time I felt heart-satisfying trust in the mercy of God,
as the purchase of Christ; and for a time rejoiced with joy scarce
supportable, singing almost continually the 103d Psalm.</p>
<p>"I took a view of the promises of God, and wrote out many of
them, and called them mine; and among <!--Page 101--><a name="P101"
id="P101"></a> the foremost was that in Psalm 89:30-33; and well
has the Lord kept me to it, and made it good: for, my dear friend,
never was there a more unsteady, unwatchful Christian; never did
the children of Israel's conduct in the wilderness depict any
Christian's heart and conduct in the gospel times better than mine;
and just so has the Lord dealt with me. When he slew me, then I
trusted in him; when he gave me carnal ease and comfort, I forgot
my Rock and rebelled. Often did I stumble too from legality,
instead of looking at my own weakness and impotence, and trusting
wholly in my Redeemer's strength. I was wroth with myself, wondered
at myself, and thought it impossible I could be as I had been. I
made strong resolutions, yea, vows, and became a slave in means to
hedge in this wandering, worldly, vain, flighty heart; but, alas, a
few months found me where I was, with scarce a thought of God from
morning to night; prayer huddled over in words that had no effect
on my heart; and the fear of hell the chief restraint from sin or
spur to duty. Then, in general, the Lord had some affliction for
me, which laid me afresh at his feet, and made me take a fresh
grasp of Christ, and a fresh view of his covenant: then again I
felt safety, joy, peace, and happiness.</p>
<p>"Thus, by line upon line, by precept upon precept, aye, and by
stripe upon stripe, he taught me that I could not walk a moment
alone. This is now my fixed faith; and in proportion as I keep it
in sight, I walk safely; but I still forget, and still stumble and
still fall; but I am lifted up and taught lesson after lesson; and
I shall stumble and shall fall while sin is in me; but the last
stumble shall come, and the last stripe <!--Page 102--><a name=
"P102" id="P102"></a> shall be laid on, and the last lesson
taught, and that which concerns me shall be perfected. O, then
shall I look back, and see 'all the way by which he has led me, to
prove me and try me, and show me what was in my heart, that he
might do me good in my latter end.'</p>
<p>"I am often, even in this valley of darkness and ignorance,
allowed this retrospective view; and am led to say not one word of
all that he promised has failed. 'Hitherto the Lord hath helped, he
hath been the guide of my youth, and even unto hoar hairs will he
lead me;' and when he calls me to pass through the valley of the
shadow of death, I shall even then fear no evil, for his rod and
staff shall support me; and I shall enter into the presence of my
Redeemer, white and clean, dressed in his most perfect
righteousness; angels and saints shall know me in this glorious
robe; my Redeemer will acknowledge me as his ransomed, and I shall
be for ever with the Lord."</p>

<p>"I have just been reading over my dear friend's precious
letters, and am refreshed anew by the same truths and uniform
experience of every Christian; which all amounts to this, that the
Lord is the portion of his people, and that whom he loves, he loves
to the end. My soul melts with tenderness when I recollect my
fellow-travellers in the wilderness; those dear associates with
whom I have so often taken sweet counsel; who so often comforted me
with the same comforts with which they themselves were comforted. I
am also led to recollect some who have finished their warfare; some
whose trials were sharp and long, but who, through the same grace
in which we trust, were steadfast <!--Page 103--><a name="P103" id=
"P103"></a> to the end; and now inherit a crown of life &mdash;
the reward of grace, not of debt.</p>
<p>"I rejoice to hear that your children are promising; I think it
is the greatest comfort a parent can enjoy in this world. I have a
large share of it in my three daughters; but my prodigal is not
come to himself; he still feeds on husks, nor thinks of the plenty
in his Father's house. I had great hopes last winter; I heard he
had been very ill in consequence of very severe treatment from his
captain. The Lord has been emptying him from vessel to vessel, and
I have been waiting the issue; but mine eyes almost fail. I have
great hopes that God's time of mercy will come. I am also satisfied
that it will be the best time; but still I cry, O how long? My dear
friends, I think I would recommend it to you to <i>keep your
children about you</i>. No other had ever the influence over him
that I had; and I regret that I did not bring him with me.</p>
<p>"Our young Timothy, J.M., is a perfect champion for the gospel
of Jesus; the Lord has well girded him and largely endowed him; he
walks closely with God, and speaks and preaches like a Christian of
long experience: he was ordained about two months ago in his
father's church, and a few weeks after married a lady of eminent
piety, and preached all the day, both the Sabbath before and after:
no levity, no novelty appeared in word or gesture, which is not
always the case with the best at such times. There is probably no
church in New York whose discipline is as strict, nor one which has
so many communicants. He is reckoned a man of great talents and an
orator; and many of even the idle and careless go to hear him.</p>
<p>"A few Sabbaths ago he preached from these
<!--Page 104--><a name="P104" id="P104"></a> words, 'I
determined to know nothing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him
crucified.' After proving that all the Scriptures, from the
beginning of Genesis to the end of Revelation, pointed to Christ
and his great work of redemption, and asserting that that sermon
could not be called the gospel of which He was not the subject, he
spoke home to his audience, and told them that this, through the
aid of divine grace, was his firm purpose &mdash; to dwell on
redeeming love. He was sure no subject would be welcome to any
Christian, where Christ was not to be found; nor would any such
subject ever convert a sinner; and therefore, if any were about to
take their place there, expecting to hear any new or strange thing,
let them not disappoint themselves. O, for a thankful heart; the
Lord has indeed done wonders for me and mine; and blessed be his
name for his mercy also, that in a remarkable manner, by a strange
concurrence of circumstances, he hedged me in to become a member of
this congregation, where I am led and fed with the same truths
which nourished my soul in Zion's gates at Edinburgh; and I am
helped to sing the Lord's song in a foreign land. Often have I been
tempted to hang my harp upon the willow, 'when Zion I thought on;'
but this was, and sometimes still is my sin and ingratitude, for I
ought to build houses, and plant vineyards, and seek the good of
the land; for he has a small vineyard here, which he waters and
cultivates, and I ought to labor therein, and do whatsoever my hand
findeth to do with diligence, and say, 'The earth is the Lord's,
and the fulness thereof; heaven is his throne, the earth his
footstool,' and he fills all things and all places.</p>
<!--Page 105--><a name="P105" id="P105"></a>
<p>"'What aileth thee, Hagar?' O what a God of mercy is our God!
Often has he hailed me in some such language: 'What aileth thee?'
why is thy countenance sad? am I not better to thee than ten
friends? Then has he turned my heart to him, made me feel myself
close to him; he has suffered me to lean on his bosom, hang on his
arm, and lisp out, Abba. At such blest moments I have thought the
whole earth but one point, and from that to heaven but one step,
and the time between but as one moment; and my company here
sufficient to satisfy me by the way. At such blest moments I felt
perfect, full, entire satisfaction with all that God is, all that
he does; and could trust him fully with all my concerns, spiritual,
temporal, and eternal. But, alas, by and by, like a peevish child,
I began to fret, wish this, wish that; grieve for this, grieve for
that; fear this, fear that; stagger, stumble, fall. O what a God of
patience and long-suffering. And O how rich that well-ordered
covenant, that provides suitable grace for all these unsteady
seasons. It is my greatest consolation that the Lord knows it all.
There are times when I cannot see him, but every moment he sees me.
I should fall off and leave him, but he holds me fast and never
leaves me. O blessed plan, where God secures us in safety, even
from ourselves. We have not only destroyed ourselves, and he has
been our help; but we are ever destroying ourselves, and still he
renews this help.</p>
<p>"Well, what shall we say? Father, glorify thy name, and let us
lie in thy hand as clay in the potter's, till thou finish thy
workmanship, and fit us vessels of mercy, to be filled with
happiness, when thou shalt have done thy good pleasure in us, and
by us, in <!--Page 106--><a name="P106" id="P106"></a> this
world, through the grace that is in Christ Jesus, who loved us, and
gave himself for us; to whom be glory, honor, and praise in the
church below, and in the general assembly above, now and
ever.&emsp;Amen.</p>

<p>Early in 1793 Mrs. Graham heard, from a worthy clergyman at
Greenock, who, at her request, paid attention to her son, that he
had been very ill of a fever, and subsequently subject to epileptic
fits. In one of these he had fallen from the mast-head, and was
rendered unfit for service for many months. The gentleman to whom
he was apprenticed, permitted him to leave. In these circumstances
Mrs. Graham addressed to him the following letter:</p>
<br />
<p>"M<font size="-1">Y LONG-LOST BUT STILL DEAR</font> S<font size=
"-1">ON</font> &mdash; If this ever reach you, hearken to the voice
of your mother, your only parent, and to the voice of God by her.
O, my son, you have had a long race in the service of Satan; he has
kept you in bondage and made you his drudge. You are far advanced
in the broad way that leads to destruction &mdash; to that place of
endless torment prepared for the devil and his angels, to which
Satan is dragging you. He has even been seeking the destruction of
your body, that he might have you secure.</p>
<p>"O, my son, think. Has he proved a good master? What have you
found in his service? and has he not disappointed all your gayest
hopes, and fed you with husks? Have you, my son, been happy? Are
you not obliged to drive away your own reflections? I know you are.
Dare you, my son, sit down and <!--Page 107--><a name="P107" id=
"P107"></a> think over all the past, all the present, and look
forward to the future with any degree of comfort? My son, you
cannot. Hear then the word of the Lord; that Lord, that merciful
Lord, who has seen you in all your rebellion, heard every profane
oath you may have uttered, seen you rioting among the sons of
Belial; yet what is his voice to you? O, my son, it is not, 'Bind
him hand and foot, and cast him into the lake that burns with fire
and brimstone; where there is weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of
teeth, where the worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.' No,
my son, the door of mercy is still open to you; the Lord calls, 'O
sinner, thou hast destroyed thyself, but in me is thy help.' Only
repent, so iniquity shall not prove your ruin.' 'Hearken unto me,
ye stout-hearted, that are far from righteousness: I bring near my
righteousness; it shall not be far off, and my salvation shall not
tarry.' 'Hear, and your soul shall live.' 'Believe in the Lord
Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved' &mdash; saved from hell;
saved from Satan and his snare; saved from the force of corruption
in your heart.</p>
<p>"I do not call upon you, my poor corrupt boy, to turn from sin
and work righteousness in your own strength; this you can no more
do than the Ethiopian can change his skin; but I do call upon you
to receive the whole of God's salvation, and power to resist sin is
a principal part of it. In God's word it is said, that the Lord
gave Christ to be a covenant to the people: we have to covenant
with him on our part; we are all poor, lost, miserable creatures, I
as well as you, by nature; but the Lord Christ is God's gift to
sinners. All the other promises are made to those
<!--Page 108--><a name="P108" id="P108"></a> who have received
and accepted of this gift; but Christ himself is God's gift to
sinners &mdash; to the chief of sinners &mdash; <i>to you, John
Graham, by name</i>; and the Bible says, to as many as receive him,
to them gives he power to become the sons of God. God gave Christ
to become the price in our hand; we take this gift, and offer back,
as the price of our redemption, his atoning sacrifice, his
all-perfect righteousness; and on this ground we are entitled, by
his own plan, which he prepared from first to last, to plead for
the full accomplishment of all the promises in the Bible: for the
pardon of sin; yea, for an entire new nature.</p>
<p>"O, my son, open your Bible, go to your knees, look out words
there fit for your case; present them humbly before God, turn all
the promises you find there, all the offers, all the calls, all the
commands, all the threatenings into prayer &mdash; for you of
yourself can do nothing &mdash; and ask that God, for Christ's
sake, may pour out on you the spirit of prayer. I know not how to
have done; yet I well know, unless the Lord soften your poor
obdurate heart, it will still remain hard. O, my son, be willing to
put it in his hand, to receive his salvation, and give yourself up
to his guiding. I beg you will read with care the 15th chapter of
the gospel of Luke. The Lord spoke these parables to show how very
willing he is to receive returning sinners. Your mother and all
your sisters are willing to follow his example; return to us, my
son. We will watch over you we will pray over you, and we will try,
by every endearing method, to restore you not only to health, but
to comfort. Your sisters wish you to come; all your friends are
willing to receive you; we will not upbraid you.</p>
<!--Page 109--><a name="P109" id="P109"></a>
<p>"Do, my dear, leave Greenock; come out to us by any way you can
find, I will pay your passage here; or if you can get to any port
in America, you can write me from that, and I will get you
forwarded here; and, after you are here, if you still wish to
follow the sea, we can get you a berth in some trading vessel from
this. All your friends here send best wishes. And now, my son, I
commend you to the Lord. O, that he may bless this to you,</p>

<p>The last intelligence that Mrs. Graham received of her
unfortunate son was in a letter from himself, dated Demarara, 1794,
in which he states that he had sailed from Amsterdam in a Dutch
vessel; was taken by the French, and retaken by the English; had
arrived at Demarara in the ship Hope; and should he not soon hear
from his mother, would return to Europe with a fleet which was
shortly to sail under convoy. Mrs. Graham notices this event as
follows:</p>
<br />
<p class="right">"N<font size="-1">EW</font> Y<font size=
"-1">ORK</font>, February 20, 1794.</p>
<p>"This day I have a letter from my poor wanderer. It is more than
a year since I heard of him. Accept of my thanks, good and gracious
Lord. I feared his cup had been full, and he called out of the
world with all his sins on his own head; for I have no tidings of
his turning from his sinful courses, or fleeing from the wrath to
come, by taking hold of the hope set before him.</p>
<p>"I bless thee, Oh, I bless thee, for thy sparing mercy, thy
long-suffering, thy patience, thy forbearance. Yea, even to him,
thou hast been more than all this. Thou hast been his preserver,
his provider; thou hast <!--Page 110--><a name="P110" id=
"P110"></a> watched over him in many imminent dangers, in the
great deeps, in burning and in frozen climes.</p>
<p>"Thou hast followed him with thy preserving mercy and temporal
bounty. He is still in the land of the living, and among those who
are called to look unto thee and live. Still thou feedest my hopes
of better things for him. Thou sufferest my prayers to lie on the
table of thy covenant. I will trust, I will hope, I will believe,
that in an accepted time thou wilt hear me, and in a day of thy
power thou wilt bow his stubborn will, and lay him an humble
suppliant at thy feet. Oh, I trust thou wilt bring this poor
prodigal to himself, and turn his steps towards his Father's house.
See how he feeds with the swine upon husks, and even these not his
own. O turn his thoughts to his 'Father's house, where there is
bread enough, and to spare.'</p>
<p>"'Lord, remember thy gracious word, on which thou hast caused me
to hope,' and which has ever been my comfort in the time of my
affliction, and in my straits my only relief.</p>
<p>"He is again launched into thy great ocean. Lord, he is far from
every friend and from every means of grace, and for any thing I
know, far from thee by wicked works; under thy curse and hateful in
thy sight; but thou, God, seest him. Means are not necessary, if
thou willest to work without. Thou canst find an avenue to his
heart at once. Dead as he is, vile as he is, guilty as he is, far
from help of man, and in the most unlikely situation to receive the
help of God, yet I know all these hinderances, all these mountains
shall melt as wax at thy presence.</p>
<p>"Lord, I believe, thou knowest I believe, that if
<!--Page 111--><a name="P111" id="P111"></a> thou but speak the
word, this dead soul shall live; this vile, this guilty soul shall
be cleansed, shall be renewed, and my son be changed to an humble,
thankful, genuine child of God, through the cleansing blood of
atonement, through the imputation of the Redeemer's righteousness
and the implantation of thy Spirit. I can do nothing for him, but
thou canst do all this. I wait for it, Lord, I wait for thy
salvation. Lord, let there be 'joy in heaven over this one sinner
repenting.' I roll him on thee. I trust in thy sovereign, free,
unmerited mercy in Christ.&emsp;Amen."</p>
<p>All inquiries instituted by kind friends respecting this son
proved fruitless; and as a vessel named the Hope was some months
after reported as having been taken by the French, it is perhaps
probable that he died in a French prison.</p>
<p>Thus again had his afflicted mother to exercise faith and
submission, not without hope towards God that the great Redeemer
had taken care of, and would finally save this prodigal son. She
had known a case in her father's family, which excited their
solicitude and encouraged her hope. Her younger brother, Archibald
Marshall, a lad of high temper, though possessed of an affectionate
heart, had gone to sea, and was not heard of at all for several
years. A pious woman, who kept a boarding-house in Paisley, found
one of her boarders one day reading Doddridge's Rise and Progress
of Religion in the Soul, with Archibald Marshall's name written on
the blank leaf. On inquiry, the stranger told her that he got that
book from a young man on his death-bed as a token of regard. That
young man was Archibald Marshall; he <!--Page 112--><a name="P112"
id="P112"></a> was an exemplary Christian, "and I have reason,"
added he, "to bless God that he ever was my mess-mate." The woman
who heard this account, transmitted it to Mr. Marshall's family,
who were known to her. Mrs. Graham had no such consolatory account
afforded to her; but under much yearning of heart she left this
concern, as well as every other, to the disposal of that God "who
doeth all things well."</p>
<p>Again she sings of mercy in a sweet meditation.</p>
<br />
<p class="right">"N<font size="-1">EW</font> Y<font size=

<p>"Thou hast given me my heart's desire, and hast not withholden

through life sought after for myself and the children whom thou

worthless servant. Thou, in my early widowhood, didst call me to
leave my fatherless children on thee, annexing the promise that
thou wouldst preserve them alive.</p>
<p>"Thou didst put it into my heart to plead the promise in a
spiritual sense; to ask, to hope, to wait for the new birth, the
life which Christ died to purchase, and lives to bestow.</p>
<p>"In three of these fatherless I have seen thy work. Long did the
grain of mustard-seed lie buried among the weeds of
worldly-mindedness; long were my hopes and fears alternate; but now
the blessed discipline of <!--Page 114--><a name="P114" id=
"P114"></a> the covenant has been exercised; I have witnessed
it, I have felt it &mdash; suffered the rod with them and for them,
but waited for the fruits in hope; and glory to thee, dear Husband
and Father, I have not waited in vain. Thou hast written
<i>vanity,</i> and opened our eyes to read vanity written on every
earthly enjoyment, except so far as thou art enjoyed in them. Thou
hast enabled not only thine aged servant, but her children, to put
a blank into thy hand, and to say, 'Choose thou for us.' We take
hold of thy covenant, and choose it for our portion. Is not this, O
Lord, the full amount of my desires? Thou wilt finish the work in
thy own time, and by means of thy appointing. Amen. Lord, do as
thou hast said."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>
<h4>DEATH OF HER DAUGHTER &mdash; FIRST MISSIONARY SOCIETY IN NEW
YORK.</h4>
<p>I<font size="-1">N</font> July, 1795, Mrs. Graham's second
daughter, Joanna, was married to Mr. Divie Bethune, merchant in New
York. In the following month her eldest daughter, Mrs. Stevenson,
was seized with a fatal illness. Possessing a most amiable
disposition and genuine piety, she viewed the approach of death
with the composure of a Christian and the intrepidity of faith.</p>
<p>She had been in delicate health for some years, and now a
complication of disorders denied all hope of recovery. She sung a
hymn of triumph until the struggles of death interrupted her. Mrs.
Graham displayed great firmness of mind during the last trying
scene, and when the spirit of her daughter fled, the mother raised
her hands, and looking towards heaven, exclaimed, 'I wish you joy,
my darling.' She then washed her face, took some refreshment, and
retired to rest.</p>
<p>Such was her joy of faith at the full salvation of her child;
but when <i>the loss of her company</i> was felt, the tenderness of
a mother's heart afterwards gave vent to feelings of affectionate
sorrow: nature will feel, even when faith triumphs. In her devout
meditations before God, Mrs. Graham improves this event as
follows:</p>
<br />
<!--Page 116--><a name="P116" id="P116"></a>
<p class="right">"O<font size="-1">CTOBER</font> 4, 1795.</p>
<p>"Why, O why is my spirit still depressed? Why these sobs?
Father, forgive. 'Jesus wept.' I weep, but acquiesce. This day two
months the Lord delivered my Jessie, <i>his Jessie,</i> from a body
of sin and death, finished the good work he had begun, perfected
what concerned her, trimmed her lamp, and carried her triumphing
through 'the valley of the shadow of death.' She overcame through
the blood of the Lamb.</p>
<p>"I rejoiced in the Lord's work, and was thankful that the one,
the only thing I had asked for her, was now completed. I saw her
delivered from much corruption within, from strong and peculiar
temptation without. I had seen her often staggering, sometimes
falling under the rod; I had heard her earnestly wish for
deliverance from sin, and when death approached she was more than
satisfied: said she had been a great sinner, but she had a great
Saviour; praised him and thanked him for all his dealings with her
&mdash; for hedging her in, for chastising her; and even prayed
that sin and corruption might be destroyed, if the body should be
dissolved to effect it. The Lord fulfilled her desire, and, I may
add, mine. He lifted upon her the light of his countenance; revived
her languid graces; increased her faith and hope; loosed her from
earthly concerns, and made her rejoice in the stability of his
covenant, and to sing, 'All is well, all is well; good is the will
of the Lord.' I did rejoice, I do rejoice; but O Lord, thou knowest
my frame; she was my pleasant companion, my affectionate child; my
soul feels a want. O fill it up with more of thy presence; give yet
more communications of thyself.</p>
<!--Page 117--><a name="P117" id="P117"></a>
<p>"We are yet one in Christ our head &mdash; united in him; and
though she shall not return unto me, I shall go to her, and then
our communion will be more full, more delightful, as it will be
perfectly free from sin. Christ shall be our bond of union, and we
shall be fully under the influence of it.</p>
<p>"Let me then gird up the loins of my mind, and set forward to
serve my day and generation, to finish my course. The Lord will
perfect what concerns me; and when it shall please him, he will
unclothe me, break down these prison-walls, and admit me into the
happy society of his redeemed and glorified members: then 'shall he
wipe away all tears from my eyes,' and I shall taste the joys which
are at his right hand, and be satisfied for evermore."</p>
<p>Mrs. Graham made it a rule to appropriate <i>a tenth</i> part of
her earnings to be expended for pious and charitable purposes. She
had taken a lease of two lots of ground on Greenwich-street from
the corporation of Trinity church, with a view of building a house
on them for her own accommodation; the building, however, she never
commenced. By a sale of the lease, which her son Mr. Bethune made
for her in 1795, she got an advance of one thousand pounds. So
large a profit was new to her. "Quick, quick," said she, "let me
appropriate the tenth before my heart grows hard." What fidelity in
duty; what distrust of herself. Fifty pounds of this money she sent
to Mr. Mason in aid of the funds he was collecting for the
establishment of a Theological Seminary. Her own version of this
matter we have in a letter to her familiar friend Mrs. Walker, of
Edinburgh:</p>
<!--Page 118--><a name="P118" id="P118"></a>
<p class="right">"1795.</p>
<p>"M<font size="-1">Y DEAR</font> M<font size="-1">RS</font>.
W<font size="-1">ALKER</font> &mdash; My last informed you that we
had been made to taste of the Lord's visitation &mdash; the
yellow-fever &mdash; but in great mercy had been spared in the
midst of much apparent danger. I have now in my house a girl who
lost both father and mother, and many whole families were cut off;
my house was emptied; my school broken up; we confined to town, and
heavy duty laid upon us at the same time. I trembled again for fear
of debt; but 'the Lord brought meat out of the eater.'</p>
<p>"Three years ago, when tried by having one house taken over my
head, another bought, and obliged to move three times in as many
years, some speculating genius brought me under the influence of
the madness of the times, and persuaded me I might build without
money. It is quite common here to build by contract. I could not
purchase ground, but I leased two lots of church land, got a plan
made out, and worried myself for six months, trying to hatch
chickens without eggs. I had asked the Lord to build me a house, to
give success to the means, still keeping in view covenant
provision, 'what is good the Lord will give.' After many
disappointments I said, Well; I have asked &mdash; I am refused
&mdash; it is not good &mdash; the Lord will not give it: he will
provide, but in his own way, not mine.</p>
<p>"Of course I had to pay ground-rent, which in three years
amounted to two hundred and twenty dollars. I think I hear you say,
I never could have believed that Mrs. Graham could be guilty of
such folly &mdash; nor I; but seeing and hearing of many such
things, I fancied myself very clever. Last year a basin was formed,
and wharves around it, opposite to the said lots;
<!--Page 119--><a name="P119" id="P119"></a> the epidemic raging
on the other side of the city brought all the vessels that came in
round to them, and great expectations were formed for this new
basin; houses and stores sprung up like mushrooms, and Mr. Bethune
sold my lease for one thousand pounds. Lo, and behold, part of it
is already spent. All my provision through this wilderness has been
so strongly marked by peculiar providences, my mind seems
habituated to a sense of certainty. I feel my portion of earthly
good safer and better in my Lord's hand than in my own."</p>
<p>In the ensuing year we find the following outbreathings of her
rich Christian experience:</p>
<br />
<p class="right">"J<font size="-1">ANUARY</font> 3, 1796.</p>
<p>"'Rejoice in the Lord alway, and again I say, rejoice. Let your
moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand.' Philippians
4:4-7.</p>
<p>"'Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and
supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known
unto God. And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding,
shall keep your hearts and minds, through Christ Jesus.'</p>
<p>"Christ Jesus! what does not this name comprehend? He is mine,
and all is mine. I do rejoice in the Lord, yea, more or less, I
rejoice always. This heart of mine is sensible to every human
affliction; my tears flow often and fast: I weep for myself, and
still more for others; but in these very moments of heart-wringing
bitterness, there is a secret joy that Jesus is near; that he sees,
knows, and pities. He is Jehovah as well as Jesus, and could have
prevented the affliction under which I groan; but for my good,
<!--Page 120--><a name="P120" id="P120"></a> and the good of
those near and dear to me, he suffered it, or prepared it. The good
of his people is connected with his glory; they cannot be
separated: therefore, Father, glorify thy name; I rejoice, and will
rejoice. The Lord can remove, and will remove the affliction the
moment it has answered the gracious purpose for which it was sent.
I would not wish it one moment sooner. While it lies heavy, he is
my almighty friend, my rest, my staff of support.</p>
<p>"'In the time of trouble, he shall hide me in his pavilion; in
the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up
upon a rock." Psalm 27:5.</p>
<p>"'The Lord is my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in
him, and I am helped, therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; with my
song I will praise him,' and in his strength and by his grace, let
my 'moderation be known unto all men.' My Lord is at hand &mdash;
at hand to support, at hand to overrule, at hand to deliver.
Therefore I rejoice always.</p>
<p>"Blessed be God for the heart-easing, heart-soothing privilege
of casting all my cares upon him, and for the blessed assurance
that he careth for me and mine: that he allows, invites, yea,
commands me to be careful for nothing, but in all things, by prayer
and supplication, with thanksgiving, to let my requests be made
known unto him, who is man, and touched with the feeling of our
infirmities &mdash; Jesus wept &mdash; and God, the almighty God,
to support, overrule, deliver. Therefore my heart rejoiceth
always."</p>
<br />
<p class="right">"M<font size="-1">AY</font> 16, 1796.</p>
<p>"'If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments,
if they break my statutes and keep not my commandments, then will I
visit their transgression <!--Page 121--><a name="P121" id=
"P121"></a> with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes:
nevertheless, my loving-kindness will I not utterly take from him,
nor suffer my faithfulness to fail; my covenant will I not break,
nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.' Psalm 89: 30.
Amen; blessed promise. Oh, it is a well-ordered covenant, and it is
sure. Of all the provisions of the covenant, this has been to my
soul among the most comfortable. Thanks be to God for the
discipline of the covenant; often has it been administered: thou
knowest, and I know in part, how necessarily, although I shall not
know nor understand all, until that blessed rod shall have
perfected its correction, and shall never more be lifted up.</p>
<p>"Many ups and downs has thy servant experienced in this vale of
tears; many tears have watered these now aged cheeks; in a variety
of ways hast thou stricken, and at times stripe has followed
stripe, but mercy and love accompanied every one of them. I bless
thee, Oh, I praise thee, that I have seldom received a stripe but I
had with it a token of love. Sin was imbittered, a Saviour
endeared, and grace given to kiss the rod, and cleave to him that
had appointed it. And now I can read in legible characters where,
in many instances, thy check met my wandering steps, stopt me short
of huge precipices, and preserved me from destroying even my
worldly comfort. In some instances &mdash; I thank thee they have
not been many &mdash; thou hast been pleased to let me alone, to
let me pursue my own way, ways so wise in my own eyes that I have
either not sought counsel at all, or sought it as Balaam did, with
my heart set on my own will.</p>
<p>"In some cases thou hast let me eat of the fruit of
<!--Page 122--><a name="P122" id="P122"></a> my own doings, and
let me weary myself in my own way, until I found it not only vanity
and vexation of spirit, but sometimes a labyrinth from which I
could find no escape: then did I cry unto the Lord; then did I
remember my backslidings; then did I seek unto the cleansing
fountain and to the appointed Mediator, the maker up of the breach:
then did I experience afresh the Lord's power to save.</p>
<p>"In how many instances has he given a sudden turn to
providences, which have been made means of my deliverance; not only
so, but brought good out of my evil, so that I have been made to
wonder, and to say,' Surely this is the finger of God.'</p>
<p>"I destroy myself, but in thee is my help found. O let these
wanderings end; fix it deep on my mind, that in the Lord only have
I wisdom as well as strength: that 'it is not in man that walketh,
to direct his steps.' When shall I learn to live simply on Christ,
by the light of his pure unerring word, and the Spirit coinciding;
and have done with these carnal reasonings, the wisdom of men.
'Search me, O Lord, and know my heart; try me, and know my
thoughts, and see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in
the way everlasting.'&emsp;Amen."</p>

<p>"This is the anniversary of my dear Jessie's birth, no more to
call us together here; but I yet remember it as a day in which our
God Was merciful to me, and made me the mother of an heir of
salvation. I bless, I praise my covenant God, who enabled me to
dedicate her to him before she was born, and to ask only one thing
for her as for myself, even an interest in his great salvation,
leaving it to him to order the means, <!--Page 123--><a name="P123"
id="P123"></a> time, and manner, as of her natural birth and
ripening age, so of her spiritual birth and ripening for glory; he
accepted the charge, and he has finished the work, to his own
glory, to her eternal happiness, and my joy and comfort. I have
witnessed remaining corruption fighting hard against her, and
bringing her again and again into captivity to the law of sin and
death warring against her. I have seen the rod of God lie heavy
upon her, according to the tenor of the covenant, when she forsook
his laws and went astray: when she walked not in his judgments, but
wandered from his way, he visited her faults with rods and her sins
with chastisements, but his loving-kindness he never took from her,
though he often hid it, nor altered the word which he had spoken,
that he would never leave her, never forsake her; that in due time
he would deliver her from all her enemies. I perceived her desires
to be delivered from the world and the body, and taken home to the
bosom of her God, since that appeared at times the only way she
could be delivered from sin. I heard her lament her unfruitfulness,
her unsteadiness: I heard her exclaim, 'Oh, what a sinner, what a
great sinner;' and, 'Oh, what a Saviour; O the goodness of God in
hedging me in, and saving me from myself; his covenant stands fast,
it is established, it is sure.' I witnessed a God pardoning sin,
yet taking vengeance on inventions. I witnessed the sinner, after
being sixteen years in the school of Christ, taught by his
ministers, and most effectually by his rod, taking shelter in 'the
city of refuge,' in the atonement of God's providing, and in 'a
surety righteousness,' and finishing her struggles with, 'All is
well.' My heart echoed, and <!--Page 124--><a name="P124" id=
"P124"></a> does echo, and will to all eternity, 'All is well.'
Glory to God; sing, not unto her, not unto me, not unto any
creature, but 'to God be the glory,' that she is now delivered from
'a body of sin and death, and made meet to be a partaker with the
saints in light.' H<font size="-1">ALLELUJAH</font>."</p>

the Lord.' Psalm&nbsp;122.</p>
<p>"'The house of the Lord, whither the tribes go up, the tribes of
the Lord, unto the testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the
name of the Lord,' to seek his face, to learn his will, to taste
his love, to behold his' glory, to enjoy God as their own God and
reconciled Father.</p>
<p>"Lord, let my heart be warmed more towards thy house; I have
sought and found thee in thy sanctuary, read thy providences, and
been taught thy will; I have tasted thy love and beheld thy glory;
I have enjoyed thy presence as my own reconciled Father in Christ
Jesus; I have been satisfied with thy goodness, as with marrow and
fatness; and yet how cold and languid at times, how little desire
to return, how small my expectations, how wandering my imagination.
How do I sit before thee as thy people, and my heart with the
fool's eyes at the ends of the earth. Lord, I should blush and be
ashamed were a fellow-mortal to see my heart at times. I may hide
my eyes from viewing vanity, but the evil lies within. O Lord, thou
knowest the cause. After all I have heard, seen, tasted, and
handled of the word of life, I am still of myself an empty vessel,
unable to speak a good word, or think a good thought. Great are thy
tender mercies, <!--Page 125--><a name="P125" id="P125"></a> O
Lord. 'Quicken me according to thy word; turn thou away my eyes
from beholding vanity, and quicken me in thy way: then shall I run
in the way of thy commandments when thou hast enlarged my
heart.'</p>
<p>"The house of God; the owner, the builder, and maker is God, and
it is his peculiar treasure. Christ is the foundation and chief
corner-stone, and his house are we, built upon him, cemented
together, a spiritual building; the foundation cannot fail, the
corner-stone can never give way; neither can we fall to pieces, or
be separated from him.</p>
<p>"The house of God; 'Jerusalem, Zion, the rest of God, where he
delights to dwell,' where he will for ever stay; the house of God,
the church, yea, the body of Christ: Christ the head, his people
the church, his members whose life is in him, and derived from him;
and because he lives we shall live also. Lord, enlarge my
understanding to comprehend more and more of the height and depth,
length and breadth of the love of Christ, which passeth all
understanding. Open my eyes to behold wondrous things in thy law
and gospel. I am as yet but a babe; glory to God that I am what I
am, a babe in Christ. I shall be nourished with life and strength
from my divine Head; educated and nurtured by the blessings of the
new covenant. I shall arrive at the perfection of stature
appointed, and stand in my lot at the latter day.&emsp;Amen."</p>

<p>"A day to be remembered. Rose at four, not to mourn &mdash; no,
but to repeat my grateful thanks to my covenant God for the work he
finished this day last <!--Page 126--><a name="P126" id=
"P126"></a> year, in delivering my weak, feeble, tossed, and
tried Jessie from a body of sin and death, and giving her 'the
victory through Jesus Christ, who loved her and gave himself for
her.' To thee she was dedicated ere she saw the light; to thee a
thousand times I repeated the dedication, begging that thou
mightest bring her within the bond of thy covenant; this was the
sum and substance of all my askings for her. I witnessed the time
of her second birth, saw the tears of conviction and remorse. I
witnessed thy loosing her bonds, and tuning her heart and tongue to
praise redeeming love. I witnessed the teaching of thy Spirit, and
the enlightening of her eyes, and the taste thou gavest her of thy
salvation; I thought her mountain stood strong, and she would not
be easily moved; but who can tell the deceitfulness of the human
heart? Too soon did we all turn aside like a deceitful bow, forsook
the fountain of living waters, and hewed out broken cisterns that
could hold no water. Glory to God for the discipline of the
covenant, that he did not cast us off, but chastened and corrected.
He repeated the discipline stripe upon stripe: I stood by and saw
it, and though my heart melted at times, I said, 'She is in her
Father's hand, let him do his pleasure.'</p>
<p>"I too was unfaithful to her, thou knowest, and often entered
into the same vanity of mind, which stifled the love of God in our
hearts, instead of guarding her and warning her; still, still the
Shepherd of Israel followed after both, and with the precious rod
restored both, time after time, till it pleased thee to finish her
warfare, and deliver her from both body and sin. Lord, I thank thee
for all the circumstances, <!--Page 127--><a name="P127" id=
"P127"></a> for the privilege of attending her in her warfare,
for the cheerfulness of her spirits, for the rich support we all
experienced, for the view we all had of thy faithfulness and
fatherly dealing, and for her last words, 'All is well.' O yes,
every thing thou doest is well, and this was peculiarly well. I
resigned her to thee with joy and thankfulness, and I still
acquiesce. Her thou hast taken, me thou hast left, to be yet
exercised with further discipline. It is well; thy will be done. O
help me to profit by every pang. Let sin be mortified and my soul
be purified; enlarge my heart to run the ways of thy commandments.
Now may I lay aside every weight, and that vanity of mind which
doth so easily beset me, and hath been the secret spring of much
backsliding both to myself and to my children. Lord, destroy it.. O
let me now live to God, closely and consistently; down with my
will, with self in every form. O purify my motives, and let my
whole heart, soul, body, substance, and influence in the world be
devoted to thee. Empty me of every thing that is my own, and let
'Christ live in me the hope of glory,' and let the glory of thy
workmanship in my soul redound to thee, and thee
alone.&emsp;Amen."</p>

wandering, Lord, thou knowest, for the work is thine. I have

that world, as having made peace by the blood of the cross. I
account it a faithful saying, worthy of all acceptation, that

have received thee as the Lord my righteousness, crediting thy own
word, that 'Christ is the end of the law for righteousness,' and
that 'there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus.' I
have received thee as 'the covenant given of the people.' In all

their head, they are thy body, and by joints and bands have
nourishment ministered to them, and are knit together, and increase
with the increase of God.</p>

intimate union and communion. I would be transformed into thine
image; I would be thy temple; I would have thee live in me, walk in
me, make me one with thee; I would be delivered from self-will,
self-wisdom, self-seeking; I would be delivered from that
philosophy and vain deceit which spoils souls and leads them off
from their head: then, and not till then, shall I cease to wander,
shall 'run and not be weary, <!--Page 129--><a name="P129" id=

thy commandments,' and no longer turn aside to crooked ways. Then
shall I eat and drink, work and recreate, all to thy glory. Lord,
send thy Spirit into my heart, that he may continually take of the
things of Christ and show them unto me; that I may grow and be no
longer a babe, but arrive at the fulness of stature in Christ
Jesus, and more steadily, and more purely, and more zealously, and
O, more humbly live to God, and glorify him in the
world.&emsp;Amen."</p>
<p>The following extracts of letters to her friend Mrs. Walker,
show how ardently the true missionary spirit burned in the heart of
Mrs. Graham, and how efficiently it was exemplified, not only in
her pecuniary donations, but her active and self-denying efforts to
diffuse information and enlist others in so worthy a cause. The
efforts alluded to in the first extract evidently gave rise to the
event recorded in the second, <i>the formation of the first
Missionary Society in New York.</i> It is delightful also to notice
her attachment to Christians of other denominations, and the
gratitude with which she remembered kindness received by herself
when Providence had cast her lot on what was truly missionary
ground.</p>
<p>"Do you remember how much I used to say about our dear Methodist
Society in Antigua? and the three holy, harmless, zealous Moravian
brethren? and how the preachers gave each other the right hand of
fellowship, forgetting their differences, in that land of open
hostilities, on the kingdom of their common Lord? Thither the Lord
brought me from a land of entire barrenness, where, as far as I
know, a gospel sermon <!--Page 130--><a name="P130" id=
"P130"></a> was never preached. Here I was brought into great
affliction, and to pass through the severest trial that I ever
experienced before or since.</p>
<p>"'The Lord brought me into this fold, a poor straggling lamb,
who had for five years herded among the goats; and little
difference was there between them and me, except that my soul
longed after green pastures and rejoiced to hear the shepherd's
voice, and when I heard it I knew it, though from one who did not
belong to my original fold; these good people nourished me with
tenderness, bore with patience my carnality. When my dear husband
was taken ill, they wrestled for him in prayer; Mr. Gilbert was
every day with him; the Lord heard and gave a joyful parting; yes,
joyful, never did I experience such joy; then they sympathized with
and soothed the widowed heart, fed her with promises, and in a
measure established her: thus they wrought with God in calling in
one, and restoring another; never, never shall I forget the labors
of love of that dear little society.</p>
<p>"How many such stragglers as I may be wandering in both East and
West Indies, and may be restored by these precious missionaries. I
owe them, of my labors, more than others. I send you a bill for
<i>fifty pounds.</i> I have received eighteen copies of the
Missionary Magazine, as far as No. 9. I have got subscribers for
them all, who will continue; pay these, and send me what more
numbers have been published by the return of the Edinburgh packet,
also eighteen complete sets from the beginning. I hope to be
successful in disposing of them also. I suppose the sermons go to
the same fund; send me a hundred sermons, I will see to get them
disposed of; send them single, <!--Page 131--><a name="P131" id=
"P131"></a> not bound, and of the best; perhaps they may pave
the way for more to follow; every little helps; drops make up the
ocean. We cannot yet produce anything; we are gathering
intelligence, and endeavoring to collect money; but I grudge that
what we can spare should be idle in the meantime; the cause is one;
pay the magazines at once, and the sermons if you have enough of my
money. I hope to remit again in September. I have a great wish to
have a finger in your pie in some way; if I must not subscribe past
our own society, I may sell books for yours.</p>

<p>"I thank my friend for her letter. I rejoice with you, and bless
the widow's God. He has indeed been so to us, to the full amount of
the promise. I have now much to sing of, little to complain of; my
dear girls and Mr. B&mdash;&mdash; go forward steadily, having laid aside the
weights of amusements and gayety, and seem determined to follow the
Lord fully through good and through evil report. Bless the Lord, O
my soul, and forget not all his benefits. We have a full school,
and a very comfortable set of girls. The Lord has delivered from
all heavy burthens.</p>
<p>"Last week a considerable number of ministers and lay Christians
met for the third time, and established a society for sending
missionaries among the Indians, and also among the poor scattered
settlers on the frontiers. A sermon was preached in the evening in
one of the Dutch churches, 'The liberal deviseth liberal things,'
etc., after which an address was read by the
<!--Page 132--><a name="P132" id="P132"></a> Secretary &mdash;
our dear Mr. Mason &mdash; which, when printed, I will send
you.</p>
<p>"The society is to keep up a correspondence with your and the
other societies. If they can effect anything themselves, apart here
in America, well; if not, they will throw their subscriptions into
the common funds and get help from you. This view is very pleasant
to us. There is great need of itinerant preachers in our back
settlements; they are scattered, and no churches of any kind; even
in some thick settled counties they will not pay a minister. These
are 'the highways and hedges;' O that the Lord may compel them to
come in.</p>
<p class="right">"I. G<font size="-1">RAHAM</font>."</p>
<p>We next find Mrs. Graham administering consolation and imparting
instruction to a lady residing near Boston, Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash;. With this
lady Mrs. Graham formed an acquaintance in New York, shortly after
her arrival in America. She was then a gay young widow; but having
a strong and cultivated mind, was delighted with Mrs. Graham and
family; and a friendship was formed between them, which ceased only
with their lives.</p>
<p>As a proof of her friendship, Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash; wished to introduce her
young female friends into gay fashionable society. This Mrs. Graham
opposed; and while she stated her reasons she endeavored to
persuade her young friend to come out from the world and cast in
her lot with the people of God.</p>
<p>"A word spoken in due season, how good it is." This was verified
in the case of Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash;, who, like her friend, was destined to
enter the heavenly kingdom "through much tribulation." She
afterwards entered <!--Page 133--><a name="P133" id="P133"></a>
the marriage state, and became a second time a widow while her
children were still young; and though not destitute, her income was
considerably reduced; which circumstances may throw light on parts
of Mrs. Graham's letters. Unhappily there was no evangelical
minister near her place of residence, which, with the want of early
religious training, may account for so much darkness as to her
spiritual state. Mrs. Graham often visited her, and it pleased God
in due time to scatter the darkness. Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash; for many years
fully enjoyed the consolations of religion. She trained up her
children according to the maxims of her friend, and had the
happiness of seeing them following in her steps. One, Mrs. J.W.,
she saw depart in peace; and her own dying-bed was soothed by the
prayers and attentions of her son, an esteemed and highly useful
clergyman in one of our populous cities. As Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash; adopted the
signature of <i>Pilgrim,</i> the letters to her inserted in the
former editions of this memoir, are noticed as addressed to
P&mdash;&mdash;.</p>
<br />
<p class="center">To Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash;, a Lady near Boston.</p>

<p>"M<font size="-1">Y EVER DEAR</font> F<font size=
"-1">RIEND</font> &mdash; The desire of waiting you a long letter
has occasioned too much delay on my part. One thing I can assure
you of, you have been much on my mind, and the subject of all our
prayers.</p>
<p>"Tears of joy ran down my cheeks when J&mdash;&mdash; told me the state of
your mind, and I thank our good and gracious God for opening your
eyes to see the vanity of this world, the corruption of your own
heart, your need of atoning blood, and of a better righteousness
than your own. Hail, my sister in Jesus; flesh
<!--Page 134--><a name="P134" id="P134"></a> and blood hath not
taught you this, but your Father who is in heaven: the work is his,
evidently his; and being begun, he will carry it on, and finish it
too. Commit your soul then into his hand; he 'came not to call the
righteous, but <i>sinners</i> to repentance;' his errand to our
world was to seek and to save the <i>lost</i>. Trusting in his
mercy, through Christ, your soul is as safe as his word is true;
for none perish that trust in him.</p>
<p>"'Trust in the Lord with all thy heart, and lean not to thine
own understanding;' be not discouraged because of deadness,
darkness, wandering, want of love, want of spirituality, want of
any kind. Who told you of these evils and wants? the Sun of
righteousness shining into your soul has shown you many of the
evils there, but the half you know not yet. The more you learn of
the holiness and purity of the divine nature and the spirituality
of his law, the more you will be dissatisfied with every thing
yours. Even a holy apostle said, 'In me, that is, in my flesh,' or
natural mind, dwelleth no good thing. The flesh lusteth against the
Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; so that the things that I
would, I do not; and the things that I would not, those I do. Yet
it is not I,' not my new nature, 'but sin that dwelleth in me; for
to will is present with me, but how to perform that which is good I
find not.'</p>
<p>"If this was the case with the apostle, who sealed his testimony
with his life, is it strange that you and I should have hearts full
of all abominable things? These realities are cause of deep
humility before God, but none of despair or doubt. All are alike
guilty and vile, the whole head is sick, and the whole heart
<!--Page 135--><a name="P135" id="P135"></a> unsound; therefore
we need a whole Christ to atone for our sin, to cover our naked
souls with his imputed righteousness, and to be surety for us; to
sanctify us by his Spirit, and prepare us for the purchased
inheritance. O try to rest in him: believe it, you are complete in
him; give up, my dear friend, poring over and diving into your own
heart and frames, and try to trust in an almighty Saviour to save
you from foes without and foes within. Read Romaine's Walk and Life
of Faith: he himself attained to a high degree of holiness by
getting out of himself, and trusting, resting, believing from day
to day, for grace, for every duty, as it occurred. The promise
runs, 'As thy days so shall thy strength be.'</p>
<p>"I cannot at this distance, and knowing nothing of characters,
offer you any advice with respect to outward means; but if you know
any truly pious, spiritual minister, I should think it your duty to
lay open your mind to him. You may find in books matter as good as
any man living can speak; but it is the Lord's appointed way, and
he often honors his servants, his ministers, by making them
messengers of peace and comfort to his children. 'Are any sick, let
them call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over
them.' See how the Christians of old associated with one another. I
am now doubly yours, etc.,</p>

<p>"Eternity seems very near. I have often thought so without any
visible cause. Well, it will come; a few more rolling years,
months, weeks, or days will assuredly land me on Canaan's happy
shore. Then shall I know and enjoy what ear hath not heard, eye
<!--Page 136--><a name="P136" id="P136"></a> seen, nor heart
conceived, even the blessedness that is at God's right hand. I have
desired, though I know not that I have asked, to glorify God on my
death-bed, and to leave my testimony at the threshold of eternity,
that not one word of all that my God has promised has failed. He
has been &mdash; O what has he not been? &mdash; in all my trials,
all my afflictions, all my temptations, all my wanderings, all my
backslidings, he has been all that the well-ordered covenant has
said. Let this Bible tell what God in Christ, by his Spirit and his
providence, has been to me; and let the same Bible say what he will
be to me 'when flesh and heart fails;' yea, when 'the place that
now knows me shall know me no more.' Perhaps when the messenger
does come I shall not know him, but depart in silence. Well, as the
Lord wills; he knows best how to glorify himself. Jesus shall trim
my lamp and perfect his image on my soul, sensible or insensible. I
shall enter into his presence, washed in his blood, clothed in his
righteousness, and my sanctification perfected. I shall 'see him as
he is,' and be like him.</p>
<p>"Mourn not, my children, but rejoice; gird up the loins of your
mind,' and set forward on your heavenly journey through this
wilderness. So far as I have followed Christ, so far follow my
example; still living on Christ, depending on him for all that is
promised in the well-ordered covenant. O stumble not into the world
except when duty calls; at best it is a deadly weight, a great
hinderance to spiritual-mindedness, and in as far as it gets a
footing in your heart, it will not only mar your progress, but your
comfort. Lord, feed my children constantly with 'thy flesh and thy
blood,' that they may never hunger nor thirst for this world,
<!--Page 137--><a name="P137" id="P137"></a> but grow in the
divine life, and in the joy and comfort of the Holy
Ghost.&emsp;Amen."</p>

<p>"How condescending is our covenant God. All we have or enjoy is
from his hand; he gave us our being; our lives, although forfeited
a thousand times, have been preserved. 'Our bread has been given
us, and our water sure;' and not only these necessaries, but many
comforts and good temporal things have fallen to our lot; 'thou
hast furnished our table,' hast provided medicines and cordials
when sick. Lord, I thank thee for all these mercies, but above all,
that we can call thee our reconciled Father; that we have them not
as the world have them, who are far from thee, and have no portion
among thy children, nor interest in thy well-ordered covenant; but
that we have them as thy redeemed, as part of covenant provision,
and with a covenant blessing, and among the <i>all things</i> that
work together for our good. Lord, enable us to be rich in good
works. How condescending, that thou acceptest a part of thine own
as freewill-offerings, and hast annexed promised blessings to those
who consider the poor; hast said, 'He who giveth to the poor,
lendeth to the Lord.'</p>
<p>"I thank thee that thou hast laid to hand a sufficiency to
enable me and mine to eat our own bread; even that which, according
to the regulations of society, men call our own. Thou only hast a
right to call it not so, for we are thine, and all that thou hast
given us; but of thy free bounty and kind providence, 'thou hast
enabled us to provide things honest and of good report in the sight
of all men,' and to give a portion to them who need.</p>
<!--Page 138--><a name="P138" id="P138"></a>
<p>"I trust thy Spirit has directed my judgment in the
determination I have taken to set apart, from time to time, this
portion, according as thou prosperest us in business, and
preservest us in health and ability to pursue it. I bless thee for
indulgent, encouraging appearances, that since I began the practice
thou hast added to my stock, and that which I have given has never
straitened, but thou hast prospered me more and more. My poor's
purse has never been empty when called for, neither has my family
purse. Of thine own I give thee, and bless thy name for the
privilege.</p>
<p>"Grant direction with respect to whom, and how much to
give."</p>
<p>The following meditations will afford refreshment to every
Christian heart:</p>
<br />
<p class="right">"1797.</p>
<p>"'As ye have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in him,
rooted and built up in him, and established in the faith, as ye
have been taught, abounding there in with thanksgiving.'</p>
<p>"Yes, just so, and no other way shall any poor corrupted
creature attain holiness, in the very same manner that he received
the Lord Jesus at first. He is' the Alpha; and Omega, the first and
the last, the beginning and the end.'</p>
<p>"O Lord, my Saviour, my complete Saviour, and in whom I am
complete, I received thee as my expiatory sacrifice, by whom
atonement was made for my sins; by whom reconciliation was made; I
reconciled to God, and God to me. I was then delivered from the
power of darkness and translated into the kingdom of God's
<!--Page 139--><a name="P139" id="P139"></a> dear Son, and have
redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins. This
same blood must cleanse my daily spots, must cleanse my very best
services; this same blood must cleanse my conscience daily, and
give me confidence in God, as my reconciled Father. By this same
peace-speaking blood I daily present myself in his presence, and
know that he sees no iniquity in me so as to condemn me.</p>
<p>"O Lord, I receive thee as my justifying righteousness,
disclaiming all confidence in my own works, throwing them aside as
filthy rags. I place my sole dependence upon an imputed
righteousness, <i>that</i> righteousness wrought out by thee as my
surety, in thy holy, meritorious life and death; believing thy
testimony, that 'the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is
eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.' Just so must I go on,
trusting in, resting upon, rejoicing in the Lord my righteousness.
By one man's offence many were made sinners, so by the obedience of
one shall many, and I among others, be made righteous. 'Christ is
the end of the law for righteousness,' therefore I walk at liberty,
free from all dread of condemnation. Not as a slave, not as a
servant, not as a hireling, not as a probationer; but as a child
and heir of God, to whom the inheritance is made sure. I have
received the seal of the testament, ratified and made sure by the
death of the testator. All the blessings contained in this Bible,
the records of the well-ordered covenant, are mine; and, Oh
glorious truth, the testator died to ratify and insure this
testament; but he lives again, the glorious executor.</p>
<p>"O Lord, I received thee as my king: depending upon promised
strength, I swore allegiance to thee, <!--Page 140--><a name="P140"
id="P140"></a> and to thy government. Just so, my dear sovereign
Master, must I go on: rejoicing in its privileges, subjecting
myself cheerfully to its restrictions; studying with care its
positive commands, and setting myself to obey; submitting with
meekness to its discipline; claiming thy kingly power to subdue the
corruptions of my heart, to defend from foes within and foes
without; and when thou callest me to fight, to arm me for battle,
and lead me on to victory.</p>
<p>"I received thee as my divine Saviour, as the covenant of the
people: the covenant arranged, ratified, and fulfilled; to me a
covenant of free gift. Receiving thee, I received all the promises
in their fullest extent, as legally made over and confirmed to me
by the irrevocable gift of Deity: and in thee, as my Saviour,
dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily; yes, dwelleth in
him for his people, his ransomed; dwelleth in him as our head; we
are united to him, one with him, as he and the Father are one, and
being one with him, we are complete in him. He is the head, we the
members; he is the vine, we the branches; he is the foundation and
chief corner-stone, we the building. Thus let us walk in him;
rooted and built up in him; filled with the knowledge of his will,
in all wisdom and spiritual understanding; walking worthy of the
Lord, unto all pleasing &mdash; being fruitful in every good work,
and increasing in the knowledge of God; strengthened with all
might, according to his glorious power; unto all patience and
long-suffering, with joyfulness; for it is he who worketh in us
both to will and to do of his good pleasure; and although of
ourselves we can do nothing, yet we can do all things through
Christ strengthening us; <!--Page 141--><a name="P141" id=
"P141"></a> and he has promised, that 'as our days so shall our
strength be.'</p>
<p>"It is well, Lord, it is well. Thou art mine, and I am thine:
thou art mine with all thy fulness, what can I want besides?
Nothing, Lord. Thou hast given me 'the heritage of those that fear
thy name;' I am satisfied with my portion. Amen. Be my God and the
God of my seed, and glorify thy name in us."</p>

<p>"'Remove far from me vanity and lies,' Psa. 119. Every deviation
from rectitude and truth is sin. Who that knows any thing of the
corruption of the human heart, and its strange tendency to stray,
to err, yea, even to pervert the plainest, simplest, and most
obvious truths, but must see the propriety of his joining the
psalmist, and crying out, Lord, remove far from me the way of
lies.</p>
<p>"The way of lies as it respects our judgment and sentiments, as
it respects our motives of action, and as it respects our
conduct.</p>
<p>"As it respects our judgment: how does every species of error
abound; even the serious and earnest seekers of truth differ in
many things, which, although they may not prevent their final
salvation, mar their progress in knowledge, in holiness, and in
comfort. Lord, remove far from us the way of lies. Lead us to the
pure, unmixed, unerring word of truth, as it respects our
sentiments, and as it respects our conduct. O how many deceive
themselves by resting on a speculative knowledge of the truth, or
what they esteem such, while their hearts remain unaffected, their
tempers unsanctified, and their lives unfruitful. Passionate,
stubborn, relentless, unmerciful, implacable
<!--Page 142--><a name="P142" id="P142"></a> tempers indulged
and unmortified, must be a way of lies. 'Learn of me,' says the
Saviour, 'for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest
to your souls.' 'The meek will he guide in judgment,' the meek will
he teach his way.</p>
<p>"'Remove far from me the way of lies, and teach me thy law
graciously.'</p>
<p>"'Teach me thy law graciously,' not the ceremonial and the moral
law alone, but the whole of God's revealed will. The psalmist knew
the law ceremonial and moral, but he wants more and more of the
teaching of the Spirit of God. 'He,' the Spirit of truth, 'shall
take of mine, and show it unto you.' The word of God is ever the
same; it contains the whole truth, and nothing but the truth; every
thing necessary to safety, to holiness, and happiness: but O, the
difference between him who reads with a mind enlightened by the
Spirit of God, and him who reads with no other assistance than his
own poor blinded, darkened reason. Teach me then thy law
graciously. I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, when I
shall have learned thy judgments. 'Open thou mine eyes, that I may
behold wondrous things out of thy law.' The psalmist thirsted after
more and more extensive views of the word of God, and still as his
views were enlarged he desired more. 'The earth is full of thy
mercy,' verse 64; this was one lesson, but still he cries, 'Teach
me thy statutes. Thou hast dealt bountifully with me, O Lord,
according to thy word.' Still he cries, 'Teach me good judgment and
knowledge. It is good for me that I have been afflicted, that I
might learn thy statutes.'"</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>
<h4>FORMATION OF THE WIDOWS' SOCIETY &mdash; CLOSE OF HER
SCHOOL.</h4>
<p>I<font size="-1">N</font> November, 1797, the "Society for the
Relief of Poor Widows with small Children" was instituted at New
York; a society which has risen into great respectability, and has
been productive of very beneficent effects. The Lord, in his
merciful providence, prepared this institution, to grant relief to
the many bereaved families who were left widows and orphans by the
ravages of the yellow-fever in the years 1798 and 1799.</p>
<p>It took its rise from an apparently adventitious circumstance.
Mr. B&mdash;&mdash;, in the year 1796, was one of the distributing managers
of the St. Andrew's Society. The distribution of this charity was
of course limited to a certain description of applicants. Mrs.
B&mdash;&mdash;, interested for widows not entitled to share in the bounty of
the St. Andrew's Society, frequently collected small sums for their
relief. She consulted with a few friends on the propriety of
establishing a female society for the relief of poor widows with
small children, without limitation. Invitations in the form of
circular letters were sent to the ladies of New York, and a very
respectable number assembled at the house of Mrs. Graham. The
proposed plan was approved, and a society organized. Mrs. Graham
was elected first directress, which office she held for ten
years.</p>
<p>At the semiannual meeting in March, 1798, Mrs.
<!--Page 145--><a name="P145" id="P145"></a> Graham made a very
pleasing report of the proceedings of the Managers, and of the
amount of relief afforded to the poor. The ladies of New York truly
honored themselves and religion by their zeal in this benevolent
undertaking, in reference to which Mrs. Graham says, in a letter to
her friend Mrs. Walker:</p>
<p>"I mentioned in my last that we had planned a society for the
relief of poor widows with small children: the success has been
beyond our most sanguine expectations. We have now a hundred and
ninety subscribers, at three dollars a year, and nearly a thousand
dollars in donations. We have spent three hundred dollars this
winter, and nearly all upon worthy objects. The poor increase fast:
emigrants from all quarters flock to us, and when they come they
must not be allowed to die for want. There are eight hundred in the
almshouse, and our society has helped along many, with their own
industry, that must otherwise have been there. The French, poor
things, are also starving among us; it would need a stout heart to
lay up in these times."</p>
<p>In the same letter she informs her of the first monthly
missionary prayer-meeting known to have been held in the city of
New York.</p>
<p>"The second Wednesday in February we commenced our first monthly
meeting for prayer for the Lord's blessing on ours, and all the
missionary societies. It was far from full; but we must be thankful
for the day of small things, and pray, and wait, and hope. The
Dutch churches, the Baptist and Presbyterian have united so far as
to officiate in each other's <!--Page 146--><a name="P146" id=
"P146"></a> churches; they have collected about seventeen
hundred dollars, and are looking out for two missionaries to send
among the Indians, or to the frontiers."</p>
<p>A few months later we find the following letter to a young man
on his joining the church:</p>
<br />
<p class="right">"S<font size="-1">EPTEMBER</font>, 1798.</p>
<p>"M<font size="-1">Y DEAR YOUNG</font> F<font size=
"-1">RIEND</font> &mdash; You have now ratified in a public manner
that transaction which, no doubt, passed previously in private
between you and your God. You have declared your belief of the
gospel, and have taken hold of God's covenant of promise. You have
fallen in with his own plan, which he has appointed for the
salvation of guilty sinners; and rested your soul upon his word of
promise that you shall be saved. You have, at the same time,
dedicated and devoted your soul, your body, your time, your
talents, your substance, your influence, all that you are and have,
to be disposed of at his pleasure, and for his glory, in the world.
You are no longer your own. You are bought with a price, adopted
into the family of God, numbered with and entitled to all the
privileges of his children. Your motives of action, your views,
your interests, are all different from those of the worldling.
Whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, your aim must be, and
will be, to do all to his glory. This must go with you, and be your
ruling principle in all the walks of life. By your integrity,
uprightness, diligence, and disinterested attention to the interest
of your employers, you will glorify God and have his presence with
you in business. By a due and marked observance of the Sabbath, and
attendance on the ordinances, you will <!--Page 147--><a name=
"P147" id="P147"></a> glorify him. By regularity, order, and
temperance, crowned with an open acknowledgment of God before all
who may surround your board, you will glorify him in an especial
manner in these days of degeneracy, and, crowned with family
worship, you will glorify him, and his presence will be with you,
and great will be your comfort. God's interest in the world must
also be yours. The good of his church in general, and that of your
own family in particular; and O, my son, if you would be rich in
comfort, follow the Lord fully, and follow him openly; and if you
would do it so as to suffer the least from the sneer of the world,
do it at once.</p>
<p>"Already you have received congratulations on your joining the
church, by those belonging to it; soon will it be known to those
who will scoff at it. But Christians and worldlings will look for
consistency; and if it be wanting, the last will be the first to
mark it. A decided character will soon deliver you from all
solicitations to what may be even unseemly, and dignified
consistent conduct will command respect. Not but the Lord may let
loose upon you the persecuting sneer and banter of the wise of this
world, whose esteem you wish to preserve; but, if he do, the trial
will be particular, and he will support you under it, and bring his
glory and your good out of it.</p>
<p>"And now, my son, suffer the word of exhortation. You have
entered the school of Christ, and have much to learn, far beyond
what men or books can of themselves teach, and you have much to
receive on divine credit, beyond what human reason can
comprehend.</p>
<!--Page 148--><a name="P148" id="P148"></a>
<p>"I would recommend to you to read carefully, and pause as you
read, and pray as you read for the teaching of the Spirit, the
epistle of Paul to the Ephesians. Read it first without any
commentary, and read it as addressed to you, S&mdash;&mdash; A&mdash;&mdash;. You will
there find what may in part stagger your reason; you will find what
far surpasses your comprehension; but yet read on, with conscious
weakness, and ignorance, and absolute dependence on divine
teaching. When you have read it through, then take Brown's or
Henry's exposition of it.</p>
<p>"A degree of mystery, my son, runs through the whole of God's
revealed word; but it is <i>his</i>, and to be received with
reverence, and believed with confidence, because it is <i>his</i>.
It is to be searched with diligence, and compared; and, by God's
teaching and the assistance of his sent servants, the child of God
becomes mighty in the Scriptures. Let not mystery stagger you: we
are surrounded with mysteries; we ourselves are mysteries
inexplicable: nor let the doctrine of election stagger you; how
small a part of God's ways do we know, or can comprehend! rejoice
that he has given you the heritage of his people &mdash; leave the
rest to him: 'Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?'</p>
<p>"Jesus took once a little child and set him in the midst of the
people, and said, 'Except ye be converted, and become as little
children, ye cannot enter the kingdom of heaven,' intimating with
what simplicity and docility men ought to receive the gospel; and
the following text also alludes to this: 'Suffer little children to
come unto me, and forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom of
heaven.' There are many <!--Page 149--><a name="P149" id=
"P149"></a> promises made to the diligent searchers after truth:
'Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord.' 'The secret
of the Lord is with them that fear him; and he will show them his
covenant.' Yet the highly enlightened Paul calls the gospel a
mystery, and godliness a mystery; 'for now we see through a glass
darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then,' in
heaven, 'shall I know even as also I am known.' Therefore, while
you use all diligence, accompanied with prayer and the expositions
of God's faithful ministers, to understand every part of divine
revelation, be neither surprised nor disheartened at the want of
comprehension, far less attempt to reduce it to human reason, as
many have done to their ruin. The Scripture says, 'Vain man would
be wise, though born like the wild ass's colt.' 'The wisdom of this
world is foolishness with God.'</p>

<p>Again we have the following merited strictures by one taught
from above, on a passage in Pope's Essay on Man.</p>
<br />
<p class="right">"1798.</p>
<p class="center"><font size="-1">"'Glows in the stars and blossoms
in the trees.'</font></p>
<p>"There the poet must stop: thus far the natural mind, richly
endowed with human powers, can go and trace a God of power, wisdom,
and beneficence: O that thou hadst had eyes to see, and discern
what flesh and blood could never reach; that all these glories
dwindle into tapers, when compared with Jehovah manifested in the
face of Jesus Christ. Every star, every tree, all vegetating,
bursting, blooming life, answer the end of their creation,
manifesting his glory as thou sayest; but can they tell thee how
this <!--Page 150--><a name="P150" id="P150"></a> God can be
just, and yet justify those who have rebelled against all his
attributes; torturing even his fair and beautiful creation, and
bringing it into subjection to their lusts, as thou hast well sung;
murmuring at, and rebelling against his dispensations in
providence; hardening themselves against his government; perverting
every good to their own misery, and imbibing wretchedness from
means of blessedness? Can all that thou hast sung bring into
congeniality perfection of wickedness and perfection of holiness,
perfection of wretchedness and perfection of happiness, perfect
opposition in nature and principle? Here thy song stops short. Thou
seest the evils and the misery; thou hast a glimpse of an opposite
good, but all means proposed by thee ever have proved, and ever
will prove inadequate to the attainment of it: the very attributes
of a just and holy God oppose it: heaven and earth must stand
amazed at the declaration that God would justify the ungodly."</p>
<p>In the month of September, 1798, Mrs. Graham's daughter Isabella
was married to Mr. Andrew Smith, merchant, then of New York. Her
family being thus settled to her satisfaction, and her health not
good, she was prevailed upon to retire from her school, and to live
with her children.</p>
<p>During the prevalence of the yellow-fever in 1798, it was with
much difficulty Mrs. Graham was dissuaded from going into the city
to attend on the sick: the fear of involving her children in the
same calamity, in the event of her being attacked by the fever, was
the chief reason of her acquiescing in their wish to prevent so
hazardous an undertaking. During <!--Page 151--><a name="P151" id=
"P151"></a> the subsequent winter she was indefatigable in her
attentions to the poor, she exerted herself to procure work for her
widows, and occupied much of her time in cutting it out and
preparing it for them. The managers of the Widows' Society had each
a separate district; and Mrs. Graham, as first Directress, had a
general superintendence of the whole. She was so happy in the
execution of her trust, as to acquire the respect and confidence of
the ladies who acted with her, as well as the affections of the
poor.</p>
<p>Her whole time was now at her command, and she devoted it very
faithfully to promote the benevolent object of the institution over
which she presided. The extent of her exertions, however, became
known, not from the information given by herself, but from the
observations of her fellow-laborers, and especially from the
testimony of the poor themselves. When she had been absent for some
weeks, on a visit to her friends in Boston, in the summer of 1800,
her daughter, Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash;, was surprised at the frequent inquiries
made after her by persons with whom she was unacquainted: at length
she asked some of those inquirers what they knew about Mrs. Graham.
They replied, "We live in the suburbs of the city, where she used
to visit, relieve, and comfort the poor. We had missed her so long,
that we were afraid she had been sick; when she walked in our
streets, it was customary with us to come to the door and receive
her blessing as she passed."</p>
<p>We next find letters to her female friend near Boston, who was
still in much spiritual darkness and despondency.</p>
<br />
<!--Page 152--><a name="P152" id="P152"></a>
<p class="center">To Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash;, near Boston.</p>
<p class="right">"M<font size="-1">ARCH</font>, 1799.</p>
<p>"M<font size="-1">Y EVER DEAR</font> F<font size=
"-1">RIEND</font> &mdash; I have just read your letter, painful to
you to write, but to me as the mother's anguish which precedes her
joy. The day will soon break, and the shadows flee away; and the
dear Saviour whom you seek, will again comfort his returning
prodigal.</p>
<p>"I will do what you desire me, and though I have the highest
opinion of our young Timothy, J.M., I will pass by him in this
case, and lay it before one of the aged Christians, Dr. R&mdash;&mdash;rs or
Dr. L&mdash;&mdash;n; at the same time, my friend, I am as sure of their
answer as if I were already in possession of it. Who told my friend
that she was blind, and miserable, and wretched, and naked? Flesh
and blood never yet taught proud man or woman this lesson.</p>
<p>"My dear friend, there is nothing new nor strange in all you
have told me: there is scarce a heaven-taught soul, who has made
any advances in the spiritual warfare, but could sympathize with
you from experience. What have you experienced more than the
Scriptures tell us: that 'the heart is deceitful above all things,
and desperately wicked?' Only the Lord can search it, only he can
cleanse it. He takes the prerogative to himself, and he calls it
his covenant that he will make with sinners in gospel times. You
may strive and fight, and resolve and vow &mdash; all will not do:
you lie at his mercy for holiness as well as pardon. He is exalted
as a Prince to give repentance, and he is the author and finisher
of faith. He works all our works in us, and without him we are not
equal to one good thought. We are his workmanship, 'created
<!--Page 153--><a name="P153" id="P153"></a> anew in Christ
Jesus,' My dear friend, put the work into his hand, and try to wait
on him in hope &mdash; hope in every situation; do more, trust.</p>
<p>"You entirely mistake the situation of others; none of us have
our heaven here: no, sin dwelleth in us; the very best have their
ups and downs. Do you think your friend is always on the mount?
very far from it. I am at times so cold, so dead, so stupid, that I
can neither pray, read, nor hear. I have begun the same chapter
over and over, still trying to fix my thoughts, and as often they
wander on every trifle; but my peace lies where you will soon learn
to place yours, in the merits of my almighty Saviour. My safety
depends not on my frames, but his promise and when tossed and
tempted, dead and lifeless, emptied of every good, perhaps buffeted
like you with abominable thoughts, the fiery darts of Satan,
casting all on Him, I am safe as when basking in the sunshine of
his love, and tasting what you have tasted: for you have tasted,
and you shall yet taste the joys of his salvation. I too have
proved false to his covenant, have gone off with the world, and
been intoxicated with its vanities and empty delights, and have
laid up for myself seasons of deep remorse; my sins have often
separated between my God and me, especially in my younger days; the
Lord calls to watchfulness and diligence in the use of means, and
he generally honors these means, of his own appointing, with his
blessing. When we either trust to these means, and fancy merit in
them, or neglect to use them as his appointment, he generally makes
us feel our error, but he does not cast us out of his family; he
chastens us, and restores us.</p>
<!--Page 154--><a name="P154" id="P154"></a>
<p>"I write hastily, just to say that you have my sympathy and my
love; for well I know, the almighty Lord alone can loose your
bonds, and give you 'joy and peace in believing.' All my advice may
be summed up in this &mdash; trust in the Lord with all your heart;
at least aim at this; I say, aim at it, for this too must be given
you. Roll yourself, your doubts, your fears, your sins, your
duties, all on him: say, 'Lord, I believe, help thou my unbelief.'
He is an almighty Saviour to deliver sinners from sin as well as
from punishment. I leave you on the Father of mercies, and will,
when the Lord enables, pray for you.</p>
<p class="right">"Yours, etc."</p>
<br />
<p class="center">To the same.</p>
<p>"At last, my dear friend, the Lord appears; appears the Bible
God &mdash; 'the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering,
abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands,
forgiving iniquity, transgression, and sin.'</p>
<p>"When was it that the Lord proclaimed this, and took unto
himself this name? After Israel, his chosen, had been guilty of
that awful sin in the wilderness, of making the golden calf, and
proclaiming, 'These be thy gods, O Israel:' David takes it up in
the 103d Psalm, 'The Lord is merciful and gracious, slow to anger,
and plenteous in mercy.' Read on, my dear, then turn to the 130th.
This God is your God, and has long been your God; his work was upon
your heart, though you could not discern it. In bondage you have
long been, but not a willing captive; unbelief kept you in bondage,
long, long after your eyes were opened to see your bondage; and
even to discern, in some feeble measure, your remedy.</p>
<!--Page 155--><a name="P155" id="P155"></a>
<p>"The Lord has wise reasons for all you have suffered: if not
now, you shall in some after-time 'know and consider all the way by
which he has led you, to prove you, to try you, and show you what
was in your heart, that he might do you good in your latter end.'
You did not wait patiently for the Lord your God; you did not in
general say, 'Though he slay me, I will trust in him:' no, my
friend has been a great unbeliever, yet hath the Lord, the
sovereign Lord, 'whose ways are not as our ways, nor his thoughts
as our thoughts,' brought you out of 'a fearful pit, and out of the
miry clay; set your feet upon a rock, and established your goings;
put a new song into your mouth, even praise unto our God.' Now you
sing the 34th Psalm. I do rejoice with my friend; I bless the Lord
with her; let us exalt his name together. It is establishing to my
own soul. I have long prayed, and long looked for this: I lived in
the faith of it, assured that He who had begun the good work, would
perfect it in his own time.</p>
<p>"I cannot but regret your want of pastoral food; yet ought I to
regret any thing? The Lord himself is your Shepherd. My Bible lies
on my lap, and I had turned to the 34th Psalm, to know if it
contained what I would point out to you: on finishing the last
verse, I unconsciously turned my eye on the Bible; the words that
met it were, 'I will instruct thee, and teach thee in the way that
thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye.' Psa. 32:8. And so
it shall be. Amen, my God, Amen. Do as thou hast said.</p>
<p>"Perhaps, my friend, by this time your notes are lowered. It has
pleased the Lord to give you a strange sight: Mary Magdalene, a
great sinner at the feet of <!--Page 156--><a name="P156" id=
"P156"></a> Jesus, pardoned, comforted, and highly honored in
after-life.</p>
<p>"This history, accompanied by the Spirit of God, has consoled,
strengthened, and raised up many bowed down since that day, many
now around the throne, who sing of pardoning love.</p>
<p>"I now wish to say, hold fast the beginning of your confidence.
Your experience is that of God's people. To rejoice in the Lord at
all times is your privilege, but will not be always your
attainment. The Lord has done great things for you, whereof I am
glad; but, my dear friend, the warfare is not over: you must endure
trials as others; engage with 'principalities and powers, and
spiritual wickedness in high places,' and, worst of all, a
treacherous heart within; which, for all that it has seen and
tasted, is yet corrupt and deceitful. The new life which Christ
gives to the soul, evidences itself in the desires of the heart and
affections. As certainly as the new-born babe desires the breast,
as certainly and as evidently does the new-born soul desire union
to God, communion with him, and conformity to him in heart, life,
and conversation. This principle is in its own nature perfectly
pure, but the old nature, the law in the spiritual members, is as
perfectly corrupt: 'in my flesh dwelleth no good thing.'</p>
<p>"In the order of God's covenant it has not pleased him to
deliver even believers, all at once, from sinful inclinations and
passions; he has provided for their final complete deliverance, and
sin shall not have dominion over them even here; but it is still in
them while in the body, and a dying body; and the remains of sin in
the soul make the believer's life a warfare, and this
<!--Page 157--><a name="P157" id="P157"></a> world a wilderness;
soul and body are diseased; both are redeemed, and provision made
for the entire deliverance of both &mdash; for the soul at death,
for the body at the resurrection; but while in the body, 'if any
man say he has no sin, he deceiveth himself, and the truth is not
in him.' 1&nbsp;John, 1:8. Look at Paul's experience &mdash; what
does he say of the believer's state? He calls it a warfare, a
fight, a captivity for a time: see 1&nbsp;Tim. 6:12; 1&nbsp;Cor.
9:26.</p>
<p>"I write not thus to dishearten you, but as a friend I warn you,
lest you fall again into unbelief. Look not within for comfort, for
consolation, for confidence. Christ is the end of the law for
righteousness, his blood the atonement, and you are complete in
him, his grace is sufficient for you, his strength shall be
perfected in your weakness, and you shall go on. Grieve for sin you
will, grieve you ought; but keep ever in your remembrance
1&nbsp;John, 2:1, and 5:11.</p>
<p class="right">"Yours, etc."</p>
<br />
<p class="center">To the same.</p>
<p class="right">"J<font size="-1">ANUARY</font> 14, 1800.</p>
<p>"My dear friend says, 'O that I could have the society of some
aged pious clergyman or Christian, who had gone through his
warfare.' O that you could, in the Lord's hand. I hope it might do
you good: yet, after all, the Lord himself must loose your bonds;
aye, and he will, and also appoint the means.</p>
<p>"There are two kinds of rest awaiting you, the one in this life,
the other will not be attained till the mortal shall put on
immortality. When was it that Paul, the great apostle, could say he
had fought the good fight? Not till he could also say he had
finished his course, and was ready to be offered up; till then, he
like others <!--Page 158--><a name="P158" id="P158"></a> had to
continue the warfare between grace and corruption; like others,
found a law in his members warring against the law of his mind, so
that the thing that he would, he did not, and that which he would
not, that he did. Notwithstanding this, there is a blessed rest
attainable here, rest from the fear of wrath and hell &mdash; a
rest in Christ as our atonement, our surety, our complete
righteousness, our title to eternal life, and all the grace
necessary to fit us for it. This is the work of faith, or rather,
this is faith itself. The soul established in this can rest in all
possible circumstances; it depends not on its frames: in darkness,
when it is tossed, tempted, wandering, conscious of unhallowed
tempers, perhaps of the actual commission of sin, though at such
times the warfare between grace and corruption is so strong as to
make the Christian exclaim, 'O wretched man that I am! who shall
deliver me from this body of sin and death?' he can still say, 'The
Lord lives, blessed be my Rock;' see the 42d and 43d Psalms. The
Christian can still say, my Lord and my God; he is sure the
conflict will end, and that his God will bring good out of it; he
enjoys hope; he feels his state as safe as in the most enlarged
frame of mind, when he can pray, praise, love, rejoice. This is a
riddle which only Christians can understand, and even they require
many lessons to comprehend it, many more to practise.</p>
<p>"Have you Newton's letters? See his second letter in
Cardiphonia. O try to fix your anchor of hope on that sure
foundation which God has laid in Zion, Christ himself. Trust him to
save you from every evil without you and within you. When your own
weakness sinks you, try to be strong in his strength;
<!--Page 159--><a name="P159" id="P159"></a> when guilt
disturbs, wash in the open Fountain. But hold fast the beginning of
your confidence unto the end.</p>
<p>"Be comforted, fight on, aim at trusting, and you shall, in the
Lord's time, also, cease from your own works, and rest, with more
advanced Christians, on the faithfulness of your own God in Christ.

almost already forgotten in New York, the yellow-fever. Strange as
it may seem, the disease, and all that it carried off, seem
entirely out of mind. No mention made of the past, no apprehensions
for the future. Country retreats are multiplying around, and people
appear as if they had made a covenant with death. Potter's Field is
filled with our principal citizens; the prison and prison limits
with many of the survivors. The rest are <i>feasting</i>,
<i>dancing,</i> and <i>revelling</i>, or weeping over feigned woe
in the theatre &mdash; a few excepted, who have fled for refuge to
the hope set before them, whose eyes have been opened to discern
the danger and accept the offered Saviour: among which number, I
dare, through grace, reckon your sister and her children. 'Bless

<p>"The city, indeed the United States, have been

loss of Washington. The utmost stretch of human eloquence has been
called forth in panegyric. His eulogium has been sounded in every
possible mode &mdash; not excepting our pulpits. The 22d of
February, his birthday, was set apart to his memory. Two of our
ministers were appointed to pronounce an eulogium on his character:
one of whom was Dr. Mason, the other Dr. Linn. The last I admired;
it had its due influence over me; but of my own minister I could
form no judgment: the church, the pulpit, the man, the words,
seemed so connected with the 'Lord Jesus Christ,' his favorite
theme, I could not realize the <i>mere</i> orator.</p>
<p>"Great things were said of Washington, and they were due.</p>
<p>"The Lord himself called him by name, girded him, subdued great
armies before him, with handfuls, like Gideon. He gave him wisdom
in counsel, and prudence in executing justice. A nation blessed him
while he lived, and with all the power of language lamented his
death. Ah, human depravity, how striking. Bursting with gratitude
to a creature &mdash; with enmity to a Saviour God; to God, who 'so
loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever
believeth on him should not perish, but have everlasting life; and
to as many as receive him gives power to become the sons of God,'
by putting his Spirit within them, and causing them to love and
walk in his statutes. But alas, the carnal unrenewed mind is enmity
against God and his Christ. O that men were wise, and could see
their disease, and the remedy.</p>

the wickedness. How does potsherd <!--Page 161--><a name="P161" id=

other. How consoling to the Christian 'that the Lord reigns. The
Lord sits King among the nations,' even our own Jesus, 'Head over
all principalities and powers, and dominions, and every name that
is named in heaven and in earth;' all these shakings, turnings, and
overturnings, shall prove subservient to the real prosperity of his

heart that gives them admission; see my unsanctified imagination
going off with them, leaving nothing before thee but a lifeless
lump of clay. Help, Lord. Hast thou not redeemed me from vain
imaginations? Lord, fill all thy temple; cast out the buyers and
sellers; thyself prepare room for close, undisturbed, holy
conference. Grant that, according to the riches of thy glory, I may

feeble, cannot climb those glorious heights, nor dig into these, to

call him blessed. Blessed be the Lord God, the God of Israel, who
alone <!--Page 164--><a name="P164" id="P164"></a> doeth
wondrous things. And blessed be his glorious name for ever: and let
the whole earth be filled with his glory. Amen, and Amen.' Psalm
72:17.</p>
<p>"Again have I and my children been fed with Christ's flesh and
his blood at his own table. Glorious things are said of thee, thou
city of our God; and rich the provision of the house of our God;
wonderful the scheme that hath made sinful, guilty, rebel sinners
the citizens of this holy city, inhabitants of this holy house.
Mysterious truth. The city itself the house of God; the temple of
the Lord, in which he delighteth to dwell. Closer yet, more
mysterious, yet equally true, 'his body, his flesh, and his bones;'
closer still, one Spirit with him. As Mediator Emmanuel, he is the
bond of union, whereby the guilty sons and daughters of Adam are
made one with the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>"Wonderfully and fearfully are we made as creatures: as a
rational creature, who can understand and comprehend himself; how
these members were fashioned; how this spark of vital flame was
breathed into the lifeless lump or atom? Wonder-working Lord, thou
only knowest. Wonderful are all the works of creation; but Oh, what
are they to thy work of redemption? To bring worlds out of nothing,
to bring light out of darkness, was thy easy work; but to bring
good out of evil, this, this was the wonder. Thousands and ten
thousands of worlds were, and may yet be created without cost. God
says, Let it <i>be</i>, and it is; but redemption! O, who can tell
the cost? Blessed Jesus, God manifested in the flesh; Christ, babe
of Bethlehem &mdash; man of sorrows &mdash; victim on the cross;
thou only canst tell. 'Blessed be the Lord God of Israel,
<!--Page 165--><a name="P165" id="P165"></a> who alone doeth
wondrous things, and blessed be his glorious name for ever!'
Whatever the cost, <i>it is finished</i>. He bowed his head and
said, 'It is finished!' This finished work is the new testament
which he bequeathed to his disciples 'the same night in which he
was betrayed,' when he took bread, blessed it, brake it, gave it to
his disciples, and said, Take, eat, this is my body broken for you;
and took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying,
Drink ye all of it; for this is the new testament in my blood,
which is shed for many, for the remission of sins.</p>
<p>"The new testament! O, who can tell the blessings and benefits
contained in this testament, this dying legacy of our dear
Emmanuel, purchased and sealed with his blood! What is the amount
of it? What the sum of blessings contained in it? Behold, God is
become our salvation. This is the amount. God himself, God in
Christ reconciling us unto himself: by his mighty power subduing
the enmity that is in us; melting our flinty hearts; drawing us
with the cords of love; creating us anew after his own image, which
we had totally lost; uniting us to himself, even <i>us</i>, who
were enmity itself, but now are become one with God, who is love.
This is the work we have this day been celebrating: a given, a
born, a living, a suffering, dying, risen, ascended, glorified,
reigning Saviour. The Lord of hosts, the King of kings, the
Almighty God dwelling with men, dwelling in men, and feeding them
with his own body and blood. 'Behold, God is become our salvation;
we will trust and not be afraid, for the Lord Jehovah is our
strength and our song; he also is become our salvation, therefore
with joy <!--Page 166--><a name="P166" id="P166"></a> will we
draw water out of the wells of salvation.' His attributes are the
never-failing source; his ordinances the wells of salvation. God
himself is ours, all that he is is ours, to bless and to make us
happy. Ten thousand springs issue from this blessed source,
specified and particularized in his Bible, experienced and
celebrated by his saints. Let us drink and be refreshed, rejoice
and praise: for Oh, who can tell the amount of our riches, in
having God for our portion? All things are ours, we are Christ's,
and Christ is God's."</p>
<p>The Widows' Society met monthly, when the money in the treasury
was divided among the managers, for the relief of the widows under
their care. Mrs. Graham, as directress, thus acknowledges God and
asks his counsel:</p>
<br />
<p class="right">"1800.</p>
<p>"O my God, I account it an honorable office thou hast given me.
I have received it from thee. Enable me to execute it to thee.</p>
<p>"Father of the fatherless, husband of the widow, make me a fit
instrument in thy hand of distributing thy bounty. Give discernment
and judgment, tenderness, gentleness, humility, and love; let love
to thee be the principle of my every action; lead me in the
straight path of duty; on the matter, the manner, the time, let
'holiness to the Lord' be written. I thank thee for this sum
towards the relief of thy creatures; be with us this evening, and
direct our determination as to the division of it.&emsp;Amen."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>
<h4>BENEVOLENT LABORS &mdash; MRS.&nbsp;HOFFMAN &mdash;
CORRESPONDENCE.</h4>
<br />
<p>T<font size="-1">HE</font> "Society for the relief of Poor
Widows with small Children," having received a charter of
incorporation, and some pecuniary aid from the Legislature of the
state, the ladies who constituted the board of direction were
engaged in plans for extending their usefulness: Mrs. Graham took
an active part in executing these plans. The Society purchased a
small house, where they received work of various kinds for the
employment of their widows. They opened a school for the
instruction of their orphans, and many of Mrs. Graham's former
pupils volunteered their services, taking upon themselves, by
rotation, the part of instructors. Besides establishing this
school, Mrs. Graham selected some of the widows best qualified for
the task, and engaged them, for a small compensation, to open day
schools for the instruction of the children of widows in distant
parts of the city: she also established two Sabbath-schools, one of
which she superintended herself, and the other she placed under the
care of her daughter. Wherever she met with Christians sick and in
poverty, she visited and comforted them; and in some instances,
opened small subscription lists to provide for their support.</p>
<p>She attended occasionally for some years at the almshouse, for
the instruction of the children there in religious knowledge: in
this work she was much assisted by an humble and pious female
friend, who <!--Page 168--><a name="P168" id="P168"></a> was
seldom absent from it on the Lord's day. In short, her whole time
was occupied in searching out the distresses of the poor, and
devising measures to comfort and establish them to the extent of
her influence and means. At the same time, far from arrogating any
merit to herself, she seemed always to feel how much she was
deficient in following fully the precepts and the footsteps of her
beloved Lord and Saviour, who "went about doing good."</p>
<p>It was often her custom to leave home after breakfast, taking
with her a few rolls of bread, and return in the evening about
eight o'clock. Her only dinner on such days was her bread, and
perhaps some soup at the soup-house, established by the Humane
Society for the poor, over which one of her widows had been, at her
recommendation, appointed. She and her venerable companion, Mrs.
Sarah Hoffman, second directress of the Widows' Society, travelled
many a day and many a step together in the walks of charity. Mrs.
Graham was a Presbyterian, Mrs. Hoffman an Episcopalian. Those
barriers, of which such an unhappy use has been made by sectarians
to separate the children of God, fell down between these two
friends at the cry of affliction, and were consumed on the altar of
Christian love. Arm in arm, and heart to heart, they visited the
abodes of distress, dispensing temporal aid from the purse of
charity, and spiritual comfort from the word of life.</p>
<p>At each annual meeting, Mrs. Graham usually gave an address to
the Society, with a report of the proceedings of the managers
through the preceding year.</p>
<p>In April, 1800, she stated that "again the pestilence had
emptied the city; again every source of industry
<!--Page 169--><a name="P169" id="P169"></a> was dried up; even
the streams of benevolence from the country failed. Those
storehouses, from which relief was issued to thousands in former
calamities, now disappointed their hopes; and those spared by the
pestilence were ready to perish by the famine. Such widows as had
no friends in the country, under whose roof they might for a time
seek shelter, were shut up to the only relief within their power,
even to that society which had formerly saved them in many a
strait. They came, were received with tenderness, assisted with,
food, advice, and medicine.</p>
<p>"Four of the society's board, at the risk of their lives,
remained in the city, steady in the exercise of their office. One
hundred and forty-two widows, with four hundred and six children,
under twelve years of age, by far the greater part under six, have,
from time to time, during the winter, been visited and relieved.
Widow is a word of sorrow in the best of circumstances; but a widow
left poor, destitute, friendless, surrounded with a number of small
children, shivering with cold, pale with want, looking in her face
with eyes pleading for bread which she has not to give, nor any
probable prospect of procuring &mdash; her situation is neither to
be described nor conceived. Many such scenes were witnessed during
the last winter; and though none could restore the father and the
husband, the hearts of the mourners were soothed by the managers,
while they dispensed the relief provided for them by their Father
and their Husband, God."</p>
<p>In the summer of 1800, Mrs. Graham again visited her friends in
Boston, whence she wrote her daughter Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash; as follows:</p>
<br />
<!--Page 170--><a name="P170" id="P170"></a>
<p class="right">"B<font size="-1">OSTON</font>, August, 1800.</p>
<p>"I yesterday received my dear J&mdash;&mdash;'s letter, which gives fresh
cause for thankfulness. The more my absence is lengthened, the less
I am able to support the want of intelligence. Let us all bless God
together for all his mercies: among those which are temporal,
health is the chief; and I believe to most mothers it is more
valued in their children than in their own persons. I rejoice with
you over our restored J&mdash;&mdash;y. O that our covenant God may give the
more important blessing of divine life. You had need to be
importunate for this, after the importunity exercised for natural
life. I thank God also for the alleviation of your own distress,
for our dear D&mdash;&mdash;'s restoration from complaints less alarming so
far as they existed, but which might have been the seeds of serious
affliction.</p>
<p>"I could go on enumerating, for causes of thankfulness crowd
into my mind; but all are swallowed up in the grand mercy, the
distinguishing mercy of redeeming love to our souls. Salvation, not
only to me, but to my house. Oh, all words fail here. Read over
with me, sing with me, in your heart, the 103d Psalm. O my God,
dare I even sigh in thy presence, under any temporal pain, or hurt
of body or mind, with such a Father, such a Christ, such a
Comforter, such a richly-furnished well-ordered covenant, such a
constitution of grace and providence &mdash; O, such an all in all,
even 'all the fulness of God.' My God and the God of my seed, the
God of my house; yea, and the God of my prodigal, who shall in
heaven, if never on earth, join the song, 'To him that loved us and
washed us from our sins in his own blood, be glory,
<!--Page 171--><a name="P171" id="P171"></a> honor, dominion,
power, and praise, for ever and ever. Amen.' O shall a murmur ever
pass these lips, shall this unthankful heart indulge even a sigh
over any object but sin; shall I shrink from any cross with such a
crown? Father, glorify thy name.</p>
<p>"I have been to church; the subject, 'be not weary in
well-doing.' Many arguments were adduced for exertion; but the
gospel was wanting. O that my friends could hear our shepherd; he
would sound his Master's voice more in unison with their own
hearts' experience, and views of new covenant provision and gospel
motives: except in the Baptist congregations, the gospel is much
mutilated here, and kept out of sight even by the few who are
supposed to build upon it.</p>
<p>"Sabbath next brings round your &mdash; I will add, my gospel
feast. I will endeavor to meet you to-morrow evening, and to have
you all on my heart, then and on the Sabbath, in that one Lord, one
faith, one Spirit, one God and Father of all, who is above all,
through all, and in all redeemed to himself by Jesus Christ, and
sanctified by that one Spirit uniting all. What subjects! I cannot
attain to the comprehension, but I experience the truth and enjoy
the comfort of them."</p>
<p>The two following letters, addressed to a young lady whose
acquaintance Mrs. Graham made while at Boston, show how tenderly
she sympathized with the feelings of the young, and how earnestly
she sought their good.</p>
<br />
<p class="center">To Miss M&mdash;&mdash;, Boston.</p>
<p>"There was, my dear Miss M&mdash;&mdash;, something in your countenance
and manner, at our last interview, <!--Page 172--><a name="P172"
id="P172"></a> which has dwelt on my mind ever since. Your
former attentions, which I also marked, I attributed to the natural
benevolence of your heart; but your following a stranger, an old
woman, of whom you know so little, and whom you were likely never
to see again, to solicit her friendship and an interest in her
prayers, spoke a language beyond nature. Either my sweet friend has
already chosen God in Christ to be her portion, and his love in her
heart powerfully draws her to every one in whom she thinks she
discerns his image, or she conceives that this world cannot give
her happiness even in this life; and impressed with the importance
of that which is to come, she wishes to cast in her lot among God's
people, that she may know the good of his chosen and rejoice in
their joy, and become a partaker of that peace which the Saviour
bequeathed to his disciples when about to leave them: 'Peace I
leave with you. My peace I give unto you; not as the world giveth,
give I unto you; let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be
afraid.'</p>
<p>"Let me congratulate my friend, which ever of these be the case.
If the first, you have, or will soon have, a peace which the world
can neither give nor take away; if the last, the Saviour stands at
the door of your heart and knocks, soliciting that heart which has
too long been hunting shadows and vanity. If your soul is
dissatisfied with the things of the world, and tired with
disappointment, cast a longing eye to the fountain of happiness.
This is the claim of that God whose name is love: 'My son, give me
thy heart.' 'Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden,
and I will give you rest.' 'In the world ye shall have
<!--Page 173--><a name="P173" id="P173"></a> tribulation, but in
me ye shall have peace.' Be assured, my dear friend, if you could
obtain all of this world that your heart could wish for, you would
find vanity written on the possession. Nothing short of God himself
can give happiness to the soul; and exactly in proportion as man
becomes weaned from the world, and his affections centre in God, is
he in possession of happiness.</p>
<p>"But how is this to be attained? By God's own plan, and no
other. As many weary themselves in vain, hunting the shadows of
time; so, many great philosophers, sensible of this great truth,
that God alone can satisfy the rational soul, also weary themselves
in vain, because they will not seek the blessing in God's own way.
'When the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased him by the
foolishness of preaching' &mdash; what was esteemed so &mdash; 'to
save them that believe.' 'I thank thee, O Father, that thou hast
hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them
unto babes.'</p>
<p>"The Saviour said, 'Ye will not come to me, that ye might have
life. No man can come to the Father but by me. I am the way, the
truth, and the life.' 'Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think
ye have eternal life, and they are they which testify of me.' The
Scripture testifies what our own hearts must assent to, that human
nature is depraved and corrupt; broken off from God; at a distance
from him by sin; enmity against him in his true character; opposed
to his holy law, in its extent and spirituality: we are also
helpless, dead in trespasses and sins. 'O Israel, thou hast
destroyed thyself' &mdash; blessed be God for what follows &mdash;
'but in me is thy help.'</p>
<!--Page 174--><a name="P174" id="P174"></a>
<p>"The same Scripture which testifies the misery of man, reveals
also his remedy &mdash; a remedy of God's own providing, by which
man may be restored to the image and favor of God, and to that
communion with him which is life and bliss. 'God so loved the
world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth
on him might not perish, but have everlasting life: for God sent
not his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world
through him might be saved. And this is life eternal, that ye
believe on him whom he hath sent.' When man becomes convinced that
he is lost, helpless, wretched, lying at mercy, and submits to the
method of God's own providing; casts himself on the mercy of God in
Christ, and coming to him, rests on his free promise, 'Him that
cometh to me, I will in no wise cast-out;' disclaiming all
confidence in himself, or in his own works, he accepts of God's
offered grace, in God's own way, a <i>free</i> and <i>finished</i>
salvation. This is the record of God, that he giveth unto us
eternal life, and this life is in his Son; who, of God, is made
unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and complete
redemption. Believing this, according to his faith it shall be.
Christ shall be in him, 'a well of water springing up to
everlasting life.' He will shed abroad his love in his heart, and
according to his promise, give him power to become a child of God.
The Holy Ghost, the Comforter, shall be given unto him, to teach
him the knowledge of the Scriptures, and to become a principle of
holiness in his heart. Then shall he find that wisdom's ways are
ways of pleasantness, and all her paths peace; then shall he
experience the blessedness of that man whose God is the Lord; then
is the way open for communion <!--Page 175--><a name="P175" id=
"P175"></a> and converse with God the Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost.</p>
<p>"If, my dear Miss M&mdash;&mdash;, I have made myself understood, you have
my view of God's method of making his creatures happy; and I
believe he will make us to know that he is a sovereign God, and
that there is no other name, or method, by which men can be saved,
but the name of Christ Jesus. But, take nothing on my word, nor the
word of any creature; search the Scriptures; read the first eight
chapters of the Romans, the whole of the Ephesians: stumble not at
mysteries &mdash; pass them over, and take the milk for babes; pray
for the teaching of the Spirit; and let me recommend to you the
advice of Mr. Newton, in his Omicron's Letters, a book well worth
your reading. 'Lay not too much stress on detached texts, but seek
for the sense which is most agreeable to the general strain of
Scripture.'</p>
<p>"My dear Miss M&mdash;&mdash;, I am now old, and I hope have done with the
world; but I have been young and drunk deeply of youth's choicest
pleasures. I was blest with the best and most indulgent of parents;
I was the wife of a man of sense, sentiment, and sensibility, who
was my very first love and lover; and that love ripened and
improved with years. My children were good and healthy; love,
health, peace, and competency blessed our dwelling. I had also, in
early life, taken hold of God's covenant, and tasted his covenant
love; and devoted myself to his service, which was in my mind a
principle of moderation, compared with mere worldlings; but very
far was I from that non-conformity to the world which the precept
of the gospel requires. Had I kept close to my covenant
<!--Page 176--><a name="P176" id="P176"></a> God, enjoyed his
bounty with thankfulness, occupied my talents, devoted my time to
usefulness and communion with him; had I prayed against corruption
within and temptation without, the Lord would have directed my
steps and held up my goings, and I should have continued to inherit
the earth, and should not have been diminished. But this was very
far from being my conduct; the bent of the natural, unrenewed
heart, is still opposed to God; and the best are sanctified only in
part, while in this life; the law in the members still wars against
the law of the Spirit of life in the mind. The goodness of God,
which ought to have been a powerful motive to gratitude, love, and
diligence, was misimproved; I enjoyed the gifts, and forgot the
giver; 'hugged my comforts to death.' Many, many light
chastisements, my dear, my kind, my indulgent heavenly Father
exercised me with; I had many repenting seasons under his strokes,
many manifestations of pardon I received, and many fresh and solemn
dedications of my heart, life, and substance did I make; but no
sooner was ease and comfort restored, than my heart turned aside
like a deceitful bow: my whole life, from fifteen till the
thirtieth year of my age, was one continued succession of departure
and backsliding on my part &mdash; of chastening, forgiving,
restoring, and comforting on the part of my God.</p>
<p>"He did not cast me off, but dealt with me according to the
constitution of his well-ordered covenant: 'If his children,'
Christ's, 'forsake my law and walk not in my judgments, if they
break my statutes and keep not my commandments, then will I visit
their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes.
<!--Page 177--><a name="P177" id="P177"></a> Nevertheless, my
loving-kindness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my
faithfulness to fail; my covenant will I not break, nor alter the
thing that is gone out of my lips.' Psalm 89:30. This is the
covenant &mdash; made with Christ as the head of all who believe
&mdash; of which I took hold in early life; my God kept me to my
choice, and manifested his own faithfulness and the stability of
his covenant. When lighter afflictions proved ineffectual, he at
last, at one blow, took from me all that made life dear, the very
kernel of all my earthly joys, my idol, my beloved husband. Then I
no longer halted between two opinions; my God became my all. I
leave it as my testimony, that he has been a father to the
fatherless, a husband to the widow, the stranger's shield and
orphan's stay. Even to hoar hairs and to old age he has carried me,
and not one good word has failed of all that he has promised. 'He
has done all things well,' and at this day I am richer and happier
than ever I was in my life. Not that I am yet made free from sin,
that is still my burden &mdash; want of love and gratitude,
indolence in commanded duty, self-will, and nestling in the
creature. But my heart's wish and earnest desire is conformity to
the divine will. The bent of my will is for God; and if my heart
deceive me not, my God is the centre of my best affections. It is
by grace that I am what I am, and the same grace engages to perfect
the work begun.</p>
<p>"This God is my God; he will guide me even unto death, through
death, and be my portion to eternity. This God I recommend to my
friend; and this well-ordered covenant, this all-sufficient
Saviour, for your acceptance: the Bible for your guide, pray to God
<!--Page 178--><a name="P178" id="P178"></a> for his Holy Spirit
to lead you to the knowledge of the very truth as it is in Jesus.
Accept this as a testimony of friendship, and believe me</p>

<p>"You have, I find, been the child of affliction: she is a stern,
rugged nurse; but blessed often are the lessons she teaches. I
have, says God, chosen thee in the furnace of affliction. It is
God's ordinary way of drawing sinners to himself, either to dry up
or imbitter the streams of worldly comfort, that he may shut them
up to seek that comfort that depends not on any transitory
source.</p>
<p>"I have no doubt but you shall yet sing with the royal Psalmist,
'It is good for me that I have been afflicted; for before I was
afflicted I went astray, but now I have kept thy word. Blessed is
the man thou chastenest, O Lord, and teachest him out of thy law.'
Many are the texts to the same purport; take them for your
consolation as a part of God's well-ordered covenant.</p>
<p>"You have met with a late bereavement, which has entered deep
into your soul. We are not called to stoicism, but to tenderness of
heart and spirit. Jesus wept with the two sisters over a brother's
grave. But still, the Christian's spirit must be resigned, and say,
and try to say with cheerfulness, 'Not my will, but thine be done.'
And Oh, my friend, great will be the wisdom and happy the
acquisition, if every new bereavement enlarge the room for divine
love in the heart, and be filled up with that most noble, most
<!--Page 179--><a name="P179" id="P179"></a> blessed of
principles. Seek not, my friend, to replace friendship with any
mere worldling; beg of God to fill up the vacuum, then will you be
a great gainer.</p>
<p>"Why hesitate to join the church? Let not a sense of
unworthiness keep you back &mdash; a deep sense of unworthiness is
one grand part of due preparation; and no worthiness of yours can
give you any title to that new testament in Christ's blood, which
was shed for the remission of sins. Worthless, vile, empty,
helpless is every son and daughter of Adam's race: but it was for
the ungodly that Christ died; it was while we were without
strength; his name was called Jesus, because he should save his
people from their sins. In that day, that great day of the feast,
Jesus stood among a mixed multitude, and cried, 'If any man thirst,
let him come to me and drink &mdash; whosoever will, let him take
the water of life freely.'</p>
<p>"If conscious at the time it is the supreme desire of your soul
to be washed in his blood, clothed with his righteousness,
sanctified by his Spirit, go and take this water of life freely; go
as a <i>sinner</i> to a <i>Saviour</i>; go at his command, put
honor on his appointment, and repeat the dedication of all that you
<i>are</i>, <i>have</i>, or <i>can</i> have, over the symbols of
his body broken for you, his blood shed for you; go, trusting in
his mercy, and leave all to his management, believing that <i>he
will</i> shed abroad his love in your heart, order your footsteps
in his ways, and in due time perfect his image in your soul. Keep
close to him in the use of means, but look beyond the means for
life and power. I commit you to our God and Saviour, and pray that
<!--Page 180--><a name="P180" id="P180"></a> he may be to you
'wisdom, righteousness, sanctification,' and complete
'redemption.'</p>

<p>In March, 1801, the health of her daughter Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash;, requiring

half a mile from us, and there lie for hours; but even this,
trifling as it may appear, has its end to answer in <i>His</i>
scheme, without whom 'not a sparrow falls.' I have retired with my
Bible, to commit you, and all my cares and concerns, afresh to that
God whose goodness and mercy have followed us through life; who is
my God, your God, and the God of our children; who answered my
prayers in opposition to my inconsistent conduct; took you out of
my idolatrous management into his own more merciful guidance. He
has done all things well, and he will perfect his own work.</p>
<p>"Now, may the Angel that redeemed you, be with you, keep you in
the hollow of his hand, and as the apple of his eye; be with you on
his own ocean, and command the billows not to touch you; carry you
to the bosom of your dear native country, where a large proportion
of his body live in him and by him; bless you, and make you a
blessing wherever his providence shall carry you, and restore you
with blessings to us, in his own time.&emsp;Amen."</p>

that the prayer of our dear pastor, and I hope of many present, may
be with you, and be answered to and for you: Lord, be with that
family, who now, on the mighty ocean, desire an interest in our
prayers. May he whom winds and waves obey, preserve them in this
tempestuous season; may they see and improve his wonders in the
great deep; may the blessings of the everlasting gospel preserve

<p>"O, how it blows and rains. O my children, how my poor heart

I gave a note in the old church in the afternoon, supposing the
congregation on this dreadful day to be different. Mr. M&mdash;&mdash;
prayed: "The Angel of thy presence be with them; give them much of
the consolations of thy Spirit. Conduct them in safety to the place
of their destination, and restore them, enriched with thy blessing,
to worship with us again in this thy house of prayer.' I write on
this day merely to record, for your perusal, the prayers of your
church. I think you ought, if the Lord conduct you safe, to propose
public thanks to that God who heard and answered, if agreeable to
Mr. M&mdash;&mdash;. Write me how it was with you on this day. Now I will go
<!--Page 182--><a name="P182" id="P182"></a> to a throne of
grace for you and all of us. O keep close to the Lord; may he save
you from a dissipated, trifling, carnal spirit; may he sanctify all

<p>"What the Lord is going to do with his and my children I know
not; but the Samuel Elam has returned to port with a leak, after
being out nineteen days. On the day of storm, she had seven feet of
water in her hold. I hope the Lord, in mercy to you, to his church,
and to me his unworthy servant, has guided you in safety, and that
the prayers of his church were answered in your behalf. O, my
children, what would be the situation of my heart had I not
confidence of your being within the ark. I desire to rejoice over
all my fears, for this unspeakable consolation, that nothing can
hurt you. I experience for you what I did in my own case, when
darkness and tempest added to the horrors of many, while our vessel
kept dashing on the rock: I, too, expected her to go to pieces
every moment; but the idea was ever with me, 'in the bosom of God's
ocean, I shall find the bosom of my Saviour.' On the night of the
29th of March I dreamt my dear J&mdash;&mdash;y fell overboard, and I saw her
floating on the billows, supporting herself by her little chair:
this is the state of my mind; yet I am thankful, and enjoy much
peace. The Lord has given me what I have asked &mdash; the
salvation of your souls. In a little time we shall all be gathered
around his throne. Well may I leave to him all intervening
<!--Page 183--><a name="P183" id="P183"></a> circumstances, as
well as who goes first, and how. O how he blesses my latter end,
how he soothes and comforts my old age; far other things have I
merited, that my soul knows; but he has not only pardoned, but
comforts, and draws a veil over my transgressions, covering them
from the world's observation. What can I say? He is God, a God of
mercy."</p>
<br />
<p class="right">"A<font size="-1">PRIL</font> 17.</p>
<p>"I have brought the reality near me, that mine eyes may never
behold you again on earth. I can say, even of that, it is well; but
the idea of the horrors of tempest, a leaky vessel racked by the
storm, and sinking by inches; sickness, nervous timidity, and the
sufferings to be undergone before the entrance to the haven of rest
be attained, is my chief disquietude, I will not even say distress,
because when these horrors &mdash; horrors they are to mere nature
&mdash; dart across my mind, filling my soul with momentary
anguish, Satan too seeking to distract my mind, the Spirit of the
Lord lifts up a standard against him, and comforts me with his own
word, the everlasting promises suited to every possible
circumstance in the believer's lot. Thousands of times have I
grasped that promise, 'Leave thy fatherless children, I will
preserve them alive.' I pleaded it for the life of their souls; He
answered my prayers; he has given them life, and they live to him.
Yes, I see the fruit, and though iniquities still prevail against
them, he still purges away their transgressions; kindles their
repentance; humbles their souls; lays them prostrate in penitential
confession; washes them afresh in the open fountain; restores to
them the joys of his salvation; seals their pardon by
<!--Page 184--><a name="P184" id="P184"></a> shedding abroad his
love in their hearts, and making them walk in the path of
righteousness for his own name's sake.</p>
<p>"Thus he carries them on from strength to strength by various
means of his own appointing, and some terrible things in
righteousness, in the course of his providence; in all which he is
sovereign, but ever consistent with his new covenant name, as
proclaimed to Moses on the mount, as manifested in the character of
God dwelling with us in our own nature, in whom mercy shone
prominent; by which mercy they shall appear in Zion, before God, in
due time.</p>
<p>"Is it so? Is this God my God, and the God of my seed? Is he
himself become our salvation? Are we heirs of God and joint-heirs
with Christ? Is our life hid with Christ in God? When he appears,
shall we, I and the children which he hath given me, in very deed
appear with him in glory? Is all this so, and shall I tremble at
the approach of any of his providences? Shall I not say when it has
taken place, 'The will of the Lord be done,' especially when
clothed with love? I trust that as my day, so shall my strength be,
and in the interim I have the same confidence for you; for 'he
giveth power to the faint, and to them that have no might he
increaseth strength.'"</p>

<p>"The wind roars and howls in my windows, though not facing the
storm, and the white waves in the river picture in my mind the
foaming billows of the ocean. The name of our God is my
consolation: 'though the waters roar and be troubled, though the
mountains shake with the swelling thereof, there is a river the
<!--Page 185--><a name="P185" id="P185"></a> streams whereof
shall make glad the city of God. God shall help her, and that right
early.' When I walk about Zion, and go round about her, when I tell
the towers thereof, mark her bulwarks, and consider her palaces, my
heart rejoices that 'this God is our God; he will be our guide even
unto death; and O the joy that my children are the citizens of this
Zion, and the heirs of all the promises by virtue of the new
testament in Christ's blood. A covenant of works it was to our
Surety, and his heart's blood finished the requisites of it. It is
now a testament to you, sealed by the same blood. Wherever in his
word I meet the character, the providence, the work of God, I read
my own and my children's interest. I hope your experience shall be
in Psalm 107:28. If not wholly, it shall terminate in Psalm 23:4.
Though you walk through the valley of the shadow of death, you
shall fear no evil, for this God, who is your guide even unto
death, shall be with you, his rod and staff shall comfort you; and
our darling Jessy he shall carry as a lamb in his arms, and hide
her from the horrors, in his bosom. I dwell much on these subjects,
and I feel comforted, whatever be the event.</p>
<p>"If the Lord has carried you safe through, and you live to read
this in the body, know that our God continues to bless us
abundantly in health, peace, and plenty, as to temporals; we also
experience the peace of his covenant, and have tastes of the bread
and of the water of life. Thanks, all thanks to our new covenant
Head for the stability of the covenant; we change, but he changeth
not. He himself is the covenant given to the people, and because he
lives, his people shall live also, in spite of Satan and his
<!--Page 186--><a name="P186" id="P186"></a> colleague sin in
our hearts: sin may, and does bring his people into captivity, but
it shall not keep them in bondage for ever. The time of deliverance
shall come, when they shall revive as the corn. Oh, is it not a
well-ordered covenant, and sure?"</p>

&mdash; Last evening was preparation sermon. Mr. Y&mdash;&mdash; preached a
very excellent sermon from the Song of Solomon, 'Who is this that
cometh up from the wilderness leaning on her beloved?' First the
wilderness of this world, next the church coming up, then the
attitude leaning, and on whom; I thought the simile well supported,
and practical, as he went on. His application was rich on the
Christian's support, where he brought into view many of the names
of Christ.</p>
<p>"After sermon we witnessed a most affecting scene; two female
members rebuked and restored to the communion of the church. Never,
never did our dear Mr. M&mdash;&mdash; shine so bright in my eyes; many tears
were shed. I knew nothing of it, and wondered to what he was
leading, when he addressed the congregation, after sermon, upon
Christian walk, watchfulness, and temptation, and the distress
occasioned in Christian society when any of the members were left
to fall into open and aggravated sin. Such was the case in our own
congregation: two, naming the offenders, had been so far left; but
while deeply wounded by the sin and scandal, he was consoled by
their <!--Page 187--><a name="P187" id="P187"></a> penitence: he
assured the congregation that they had given great evidence of deep
contrition; and were now come forward to acknowledge their crime
before their offended and grieved brethren, and to give all the
satisfaction in their power, by submitting to the censure of the
church in this public manner, which, although painful to him, he
must pronounce according to God's appointment. 'Them who sin before
all, rebuke before all.' He then asked them to rise; scarce an
individual turned to look; many were weeping while he laid before
them their guilt in strong, yet tender terms; and finished by
expressing his approbation of their thus submitting to the rod, and
exhorting them to humility and redoubled watchfulness. Then again
he addressed the members, requesting them to receive into their
Christian love and affection their repenting, returning sisters;
that they would treat them with tenderness, and restore them in the
spirit of meekness, considering themselves as also in the body and
subject to temptation. 'Let no one put them in remembrance of the
sin which the Father of mercies has blotted out, nor open those
wounds which he has closed,' 'He doth not chide continually, nor
retain his anger for ever.'</p>
<p>"May the Lord bless the discipline of his church; may he meet us
to-morrow with multiplied pardons: may he melt our hearts to
contrition, heal our backslidings, and manifest himself as married
unto us; may he bring us into his banqueting house and his banner
over us be love; may his grace be magnified and his name glorified;
and may he send a portion to my dear children &mdash; yea, a
Benjamin's portion; may he open wide the leaves of that new
testament, and let <!--Page 188--><a name="P188" id="P188"></a>
them read their rich inheritance and rejoice in their portion.</p>

you, and cause his face to shine on you, prays your affectionate

<p>"I would fain begin to hope that my children are now on, or near
the green fields of Albion. Many a severe gale has agitated them,
and tried their faith and confidence before this day. But as He who
sitteth on the clouds, commanding and governing the elements, is
their own God in covenant, who loves them, careth for them, and
perfects what concerns them, I hope they have had much of his
presence: I hope they have found, even on the boisterous ocean,
amidst the horrors of the swelling deep, agitated with winds and
tempests, all things necessary to life and godliness in these great
and precious promises, accompanied by divine power, by which they
are made partakers of divine life, and escape the pollution that is
in the world through lust. I hope they are enriched in experience,
and advanced in the divine life, by all they have suffered, and all
they have tasted of divine support in their sufferings; that Christ
is still more precious, his word more tried, and their confidence
in him more established: if so, great is their gain. And our
darling J&mdash;&mdash;, being a sharer in the suffering, shall, at her God's
hand, be also a gainer, though it be not evident to our perception.
O how rich is the Christian, how inexhaustible his portion!

charm the listening ear, we have some sweet chirpers of his praise;
and what is wanting to the ear, is made up to the eye, for in
beauty they excel.</p>

&mdash; Difficult it is for me to exercise patience: the 23d, of
this month will make three months since you waved the handkerchief
on board the Mars, off the Battery. I had made up my mind not to
give way to expectation short of three months; they are nearly
past: how many events take place in that space of time; how many
duties ought to be performed; how many sins are really committed;
how guilty to wish to annihilate the time that a
<!--Page 190--><a name="P190" id="P190"></a> certain event may
come round. For every moment of time we must account, and not one
moment of it can we recall. Much you have seen; much you have
suffered; much, perhaps, also enjoyed: for the Lord can give songs
in the night, and in a dungeon. 'Surely his salvation is nigh them
that fear him;' to them there is no want. The Lord is their
shepherd, he feedeth them in green pastures beside the gently
flowing waters; if they wander, he restoreth them, perhaps with the
rod, but it is the rod of love; they need not be afraid to enter
even the valley of the shadow of death; their Shepherd is with
them, and his rod, rod of support, and staff shall comfort
them.</p>
<p>"I hope this has been a profitable time to you both; that you
have seen more of the evil of sin, and of your own hearts, their
deceitful double turnings and windings to cover and conceal the
enemy of God and your own souls; more of the extent and
spirituality of the divine law, fulfilled indeed in every jot and
tittle by your Surety; but still doubly binding on you as a rule of
life in the hand of your Redeemer, who hath bought you to himself,
and taken you into his own hands, that you might be a holy people
to himself, delivered not merely from the penalty and curse, but
from the power and indwelling of sin. I hope you have seen more of
the unsearchable riches of Christ in all he has done and is now
doing for your and his church's happiness, and of those exceeding
great and precious promises by which you are made partakers of
the-divine life, and privileged to escape the pollution that is in
the world through lust; more of the faithfulness of God, as a God
in Christ, pardoning sin and reconciling you to himself;

teaching you by his word, Spirit, and providences.</p>

character opening upon me as a sinner, in heart and tongue and
conduct, against my God, my neighbor, and my own soul: how comes it
then that I am at ease in God's world; in health, in peace, in
comfort, all in an extraordinary degree as to temporals; and as to
spirituals, though grieved with self, my joy in Christ also
abounds. Can I believe it? What can I say; what can I render to the
Lord for all his gifts to me? Nothing can I do, but just take the
cup of salvation, calling upon the name of the Lord, and remain an
eternal debtor to his grace for spirituals and temporals."</p>

month for Britain; his errand is to state the situation of this
country, as greatly in want of ministers and the means of educating
ministers. Many of his people are dissatisfied, as he has two
congregations to supply, and a large family of his own. Why should
he be the man? For my own part, I think he is the very man; and I
am thankful to feel a degree of disinterestedness. Though I love my
minister, value his ministry and his person, I hope the general
interest of Christ's body is more dear to me, and of infinitely
more importance than my private comfort, which, after
<!--Page 192--><a name="P192" id="P192"></a> all, I do not
believe can suffer by parting cheerfully with its apparent food to
Christ, who himself is the sum and substance of all that any
minister can be instrumental in conveying. All means are alike to
him, or no means. I therefore rejoice in his will, and pray that
the Lord may prosper him, give him a double portion of his Spirit,
and favor in the eyes of all whose influence is necessary to
advance the Redeemer's kingdom in America.</p>
<p>"Our friend Mrs. K&mdash;&mdash; is gone; she died suddenly: both Mr. and
Mrs. T&mdash;&mdash; died at their country-seat; he first. She fancied she
was getting better. The physician advised her not to ride, as she
could not stand the fatigue; she had more faith in air and
exercise: the last day she went out she fainted getting into the
carriage, and again coming out; and died in the afternoon. She
lived near us, yet I never saw her, nor offered one kind office
towards the salvation of her soul, which, if lost, leaves me not
innocent of her blood, and if saved, as I hope it may be, my sinful
neglect is not the less. What a picture in them of the vanity of
all under the sun; and in me of the evil of procrastination, for I
meant to visit her. O my Saviour, is this the return I make for the
millions of pardons which thou hast passed on my account; sparing
even the rod, and blessing me with health, restored limbs, and
mercy on mercy, comfort on comfort? I want words to paint my
abominable ingratitude, indolence, and cruelty; and yet, Oh yet I
am spared, and my mercies are spared, as far as I know &mdash; but
trial may be at hand. Perhaps I write what my children may never
read. Well, even then, mercy, mercy shall be my song; for I sing

mercies temporal, mercies spiritual, mercies eternal, multiplied
mercies? The one thing that I asked of the Lord has been answered
in full, and Oh, how much added. God himself become my salvation,
and the salvation of my house; how unspeakable the blessing.
Although chastisement and affliction were the means of correction
and sanctification, or even the vengeance taken on my inventions,
yet, as a God, he at the same time pardoneth. For Oh, my character
is ever the same with backsliding Judah and treacherous Israel.
Glory to that name which is ever the same, and changeth not. 'The
Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, abundant
in goodness and truth, forgiving iniquity, transgression, and sin.'
This was his name among a stiff-necked people, an idolatrous,
ungrateful people; this is his name to me alike in character. O how
he has magnified this name to me, a backslider in heart and life;
multiplying pardons while I have multiplied transgressions: still
he has been last with me, healing my backsliding; restoring my
soul; leading me to the open fountain; giving faith to wash, and
joy and peace in believing; not only so, but in this land of
drought, this waste howling wilderness, this vale of tears, where
'man is born to trouble as the sparks fly upwards,' my cup with
temporal comfort is full and running over; all his creatures
minister to my comfort; and as days and nights roll on, his daily
providence adds, and diminishes not.</p>
<p>"I had hardly hoped to see the faces of my children
<!--Page 194--><a name="P194" id="P194"></a> again; for he
commanded, and raised the stormy winds and lifted up the waves of
the sea; they mounted to heaven and sunk again to the deep; death
with all its <i>natural</i> horrors surrounded them; the deep
yawned to devour them; but God, their own God, was at hand, their
anchor of hope, their ark of safety, their hiding-place till the
calamity was past: they cried to him, and he saved them out of
their distresses; he made the storm a calm, and the waves thereof
still, and brought them to the desired haven. This trouble was not
unto death, but for the glory of God and the exercising of your
faith, for the manifestation of his power and goodness, and the
enriching of your experience.</p>

grace: among the last, the mother and sisters of the kindest and
best of husbands; they receiving her as their own flesh and blood,
as well as their fellow-member in Christ; blest with a measure of
health to enjoy all, and a measure of grace <!--Page 195--><a name=

invisible hand of a covenant God, preserving, leading, guiding
through every step &mdash; his love the marrow of the whole, and
their charter for safety, even amidst the dangers of
prosperity.</p>
<p>"Is not godliness gain? profitable for this life as well as that
which is to come? What is the portion of the worldling? even in
this life 'shadowy joy or solid woe,' without a balance to the
first, or consolation in the last; no sure footing in the one, nor
support in the other; distanced from the fountain of happiness by
nature, prosperity incrusts their hearts and increases their
carnality; nestling in their worldly comforts, they forget they are
the creatures of a day, that an endless eternity lies before them,
and only the feeble uncertain thread of life between them and that
curse under which they were born. Not so the child of God; all
things work together for his good &mdash; <i>all things;</i> his
standing is not in himself; his footsteps are directed by infinite
wisdom: he is kept by the power of God, through faith, unto
salvation. Nothing can separate him from the love of God. His life
is hid with Christ in God: there is cause to rejoice always; his
privileges are boundless, infinite, for God himself is become his
salvation.</p>
<p>"Have we then any cause for fear? Yes, my children, yes; though
nothing can rob us of our charter, there is another side to be
beheld. In Christ we have all things richly to enjoy, but we have
not all in possession: what we have is by faith; all is secured by
our Surety for eternity. We shall overcome by the blood of the
Lamb; but by the constitution of the covenant we must enter into
that rest, that perfect <!--Page 196--><a name="P196" id=
"P196"></a> rest, through great tribulation. While our eternal
salvation is secured by our Surety, it hath pleased infinite Wisdom
to appoint another connection, which shall exist while we remain on
earth: even the connection between our steadfastness, consequently
our comfort, and the means of grace which he hath appointed, making
the first to depend in a great measure on our diligent use of the
last, insomuch that a great number of the promises are proposed
conditionally. Many exhortations are given in this view, and also
many threatenings. 'They that wait on the Lord shall renew their
strength,' etc. 'Seek, and ye shall find; ask, and ye shall
receive; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.' 'Abide in me; as
the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, no more can ye, except ye
abide in me.'</p>
<p>"Close, intimate, near communion with God, is to be sought by
means of prayer, meditation, and reading. If the Christian be
careful to husband time, and set apart a portion for God, and set
about these duties, he will not always miss communion; and this
prepares him for other duties, and arms him against temptation; as
the promise is concerned to keep him in perfect peace whose mind is
stayed on Him. 'If ye, being evil, know how to give good gifts to
your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give his
Holy Spirit to them that ask him.' 'So shall ye know the Lord, if
ye follow on to-know him.' 'Delight thyself in God, he will give
thee the desire of thy heart.' 'Nevertheless, I will be inquired of
by the house of Israel,' etc. 'If his children forsake my laws, and
go astray, I will visit their faults,' etc. 'Watch and pray, that
ye enter not into temptation.' 'But thou, when
<!--Page 197--><a name="P197" id="P197"></a> thou prayest, enter
into thy closet,' etc. 'Thy Father, who seeth in secret, shall
reward thee openly.' All is laid before us in the Scriptures, in
the view of comfort during our pilgrimage, as well as the certainty
of our inheritance in the end; the ground whereon we stand, our
danger, and the means of safety. See Eph.&nbsp;6:11.</p>
<p>"There is provision made in the covenant for great comfort,
consistent with human frailty and imperfection, but not with
carelessness and negligence. While, therefore, we rejoice in the
Lord, we have good reason to join trembling with our exultation;
while standing high in comfort, to take heed lest we fall, through
the deceitfulness of sin. We carry about with us 'a body of sin and
death;' 'the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom
he may devour.' We wrestle not with flesh and blood, but with
principalities and powers,' etc. We live in a world lying in
wickedness; the captives of sin and Satan exerting every faculty to
banish all thoughts of God, death, and eternity; contriving, with
unwearied industry and amazing ingenuity, new gratifications for
body and mind in endless variety, suited to all constitutions, all
tempers and dispositions, and to those in all circumstances. Of
these, the most rational are the most subtle, and, in the hand of
the enemy, the most calculated to keep men ignorant of themselves,
their misery, and of the great salvation; and alas, by these he
often <i>spoils</i> unwary Christians, who, though heirs of heaven,
heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ, are, during their
minority, subject to like passions with themselves, and ever in
danger of being spoiled of their comforts when off their guard.</p>
<!--Page 198--><a name="P198" id="P198"></a>
<p>"With the people of the world Christians have much to do: they
are fellow-members of society with them; they have many duties to
perform to them, with them, and by them; many of the things of the
world are necessary to them, many of its pleasures lawful; for 'the
earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof,' and he gives them of
it as his wisdom sees good for them. That which he gives them they
gather in the same manner as and in society with the world, by
industry and diligence in their lawful calling and business.
Keeping near the Captain of salvation, and armed in his whole
armor, they are safe. When off their guard, the vigilant enemy
gains some advantage, and they get into trouble. O how many
gracious names our dear Redeemer has assumed in his word, for our
comfort, our meditation, our spiritual exercise; how pleasant and
delightful in the light of his countenance to analyze them! Besides
the names peculiar to himself as God-man, how many has he
condescended to take from among men, and the natural comforts and
safeguards of men &mdash; our Shepherd, our Rock, our Ark, all the
relations in life &mdash; and ends with our All in all. But I must
have done, that I may tell you that goodness and mercy follow us in
this family also."</p>

a grandchild, "is very ill; she appears to be in a stupor. Two
physicians are attending, but my eyes are to the Lord. She is his
own, given to him by faith, as a covenant God in Christ for her in
particular, for ourselves and our children. I desire not to draw
back, but, the Lord strengthening me, to give up at his call. If it
be his will to spare her, she is still his own, to be done by,
with, and for, as his infinite wisdom may see fit, for his own
glory and her eternal interest. If he is about to remove her out of
the world, she is his own; out of the mouth of this babe will he
perfect praise; with that company of whom is the kingdom of heaven,
she shall join in the song of Moses and the Lamb, 'to Him that
loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood, to him be
glory, honor, dominion, and power.'</p>
<p>"O Lord, one petition I prefer &mdash; if it be thy will to take
her out of the world, take her in thine arms and carry her through
the dark valley; grant to her a gentle and easy passage, and an
abundant entrance into thy kingdom; and tune our hearts to sing,
'The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name

<p>"This day the dear Isabella joined the church triumphant, and
took her place among that company <!--Page 201--><a name="P201" id=
"P201"></a> which Christ has pronounced blessed. I yesterday
asked of the Lord that he would take her in his arms and carry her
through the dark valley, that he would give her a gentle and easy
passage, and an abundant entrance into his kingdom. He heard my
prayer; it was indeed soft and gentle; not a struggle, not a groan;
and the affliction which brought down the frame was moderate
throughout. I was enabled to resign the Lord's own into his own
hand, in the faith that he did receive, and would keep that which I
committed to him.</p>
<p>"My soul is satisfied &mdash; more than satisfied; I rejoice,
and congratulate the lovely babe on her early escape from a world
of sin and sorrow, to the arms of her dear Redeemer, and to perfect
blessedness with him."</p>
<br />
<p class="right">"N<font size="-1">OVEMBER</font> 24.</p>
<p>"It is done &mdash; finished &mdash; the soul with God, the body
in the tomb. It is all well; yes, our covenant God, thou doest all
things well. I firmly believe thy mercy is over all thy works.
Goodness, mercy, yea, loving-kindness has marked thy every step. I
believe it now. I shall see it soon.</p>
<p>"Now, our God, follow this bereavement with thy purifying,
sanctifying grace. Enable us all to search and try our ways. Lead
our souls into a knowledge of the secret corruptions of our hearts,
that we may confess and mourn over them, wash in the blood of
Christ, be pardoned, restored, and get a great victory. Enable us
through life to abide in Christ; to keep close to thee, transacting
all our affairs with thee, before they come into the view of the
world. Let thy wisdom and thy Spirit, in connection with thy
providences, <!--Page 202--><a name="P202" id="P202"></a> be our
counsellors. O keep us in a dependent frame of mind, humble and
watchful. Strip us of all self-confidence. May we at the same time
be strong in the Lord and in the power of thy might; rejoicing in
thee, the God of our salvation, the strength of our heart, and our
portion for ever. Glory, glory, glory, to Father, Son, and blessed

<p class="right">"D<font size="-1">ECEMBER</font>, 1801.</p>
<p>"It is my earnest desire to 'grow in grace, and in the knowledge
of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,' It is my desire to love the
Lord my God with all my heart, with all my soul, with all my
strength, and with all my mind; and to love my neighbor as myself,
so as to do to Mm whatever I could expect from Christian principles
in him, on an exchange of circumstances.</p>
<p>"It is my desire to give all diligence to add to my faith
virtue, to virtue knowledge, to knowledge temperance, to temperance
patience, to patience godliness, to godliness brotherly kindness,
to brotherly kindness charity, that these things being in me and
abounding, I may be neither barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge
of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>"I desire to grow in grace day by day, to profit by every
ordinance of God's appointing, and by every providence; and I pray,
Lord, I pray that thou wouldst grant me my desire, so as that I may
become more spiritual, more discerning in the Scriptures, more
fruitful in good works: that thou mayest increase also my humility.
Open to my view more of the extent and spirituality of thy divine
law; the majesty, purity, holiness, of thy nature; the exceeding
sinfulness of sin; the hidden corruptions of my own heart, and my
<!--Page 203--><a name="P203" id="P203"></a> inability to search
them out, and to crucify them: give me also more just views of my
past life, that I may ever be convinced that I am, what I really
am, the very chief of sinners, and the least of all saints; and
that it is entirely of grace that I am what I am. O make out this
promise to me; I will record it in thine own words: 'I will
establish my covenant with thee: and thou shalt know that I am the
Lord,' Ezekiel 16:62. I confess myself the character described in
the two foregoing chapters; and though thou hast chastened me ten
thousand times less than my iniquities deserve, even by the
constitution of the new covenant, thou hast chastened me. Now, O
Lord, most merciful and gracious, who 'pardonest iniquity,
transgression, and sin,' for thy name's sake, do to and for me as
thou hast said: 'I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou
shalt know that I am the Lord. That thou mayest remember, and be
confounded, and never open thy mouth any more because of thy shame,
when I am pacified towards thee for all that thou hast done, saith
the Lord God.'&emsp;Amen."</p>
<br />
<p class="center">To Mr. and Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash;, in Britain.</p>
<p class="right">"D<font size="-1">ECEMBER</font> 7, 1801.</p>
<p>"I have received my dear J&mdash;&mdash;'s three letters from Dingwall:
fresh matter of praise to our covenant God. You have had your
season of affliction; and now you have a season of refreshing, a
resting-time. The cup of the Christian is always more or less
mixed. Your afflictions have ever been mixed with much mercy, and
now your season of rest is also mixed. I well know that no temporal
comfort can compensate the absence of your justly beloved D&mdash;&mdash;.
He, however, who is the God of both, who goes with
<!--Page 204--><a name="P204" id="P204"></a> him, and stays with
you, can not only support, but comfort. The omniscient, the
omnipresent, the omnipotent God is our God, and the God of our
house; all that he is is ours, to bless us. Behold, God is become
our salvation. Every endearing name known among men he takes to
himself, to inspire us with pleasing, confiding love &mdash; every
name that connects the idea of protection, to keep our minds in
quiet peace, in the assurance of safety: Father, Husband, Brother,
Friend, Prophet, Priest, King, Physician, Help, Health, Light,
Life, Counsellor, Guide, Sanctuary, Anchor &mdash; but I should
fill my sheet. I said it all at first: God is ours, and ours with
the knowledge of all our backslidings, which he heals; our
wanderings, from which he restores us; and our sins, which he
forgives: one of his names is the God of pardons. He delights in
mercy. Are we not his witnesses? What has our whole life been, but
sin, backslidings, and wanderings? What have his dealings with us
been, but pardons, healings, restorations? Therefore we remain, as
at this day, with our desires towards him, and our faces
Zion-wards. What he hath begun he will perfect, and in a little
while our eyes shall behold him, our hearts shall enjoy him, we
shall be like him, and see him as he is."</p>
<br />
<p class="center">To the same.</p>
<p class="right">"D<font size="-1">ECEMBER</font> 26, 1801.</p>
<p>"I rejoice over my dear children, and bless our gracious God
that he has led them a sweet and most delightful sojourning among
his churches, animating their spirits by their mutual communion;
blessing them, and, I hope, making them blessings. I pray the Lord
may make our dear D&mdash;&mdash; an instrument <!--Page 205--><a name="P205"
id="P205"></a> among others of spreading his gospel, building up
his church, and pulling down the strong-holds of Satan; and that
you may be in your place a help-meet for him, in this as in every
thing else. May the Lord choose his path and direct his steps, and
yours with him. Women were helpers of the apostles and others in
Paul's days: at the same time care must ever be taken not to
obtrude in any respect. I pray that you may be kept spiritual and
humble: eminence in God's service is truly desirable, if the heart
be kept humble. If the Lord open the eyes to behold more of the
extent and spirituality of his law, the holiness and purity of his
nature, the evil of sin, and its contrariety to all that is in God;
and if he turn the eyes inward to the hidden corruptions of the
heart, when it is evident to the soul that all is of grace, then
may eminent services be safe.</p>
<p>"'I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes,' was the
exercise of Job; and justly so. Job, who was eyes to the blind and
feet to the lame, a father to the poor, and the cause which he knew
not he searched it out: when the ear heard him, it blessed him;
when the eye saw him, it gave witness to him; who withheld not the
poor from his desire, nor caused the eye of the widow to fail; the
stranger did not lodge in the street, but he opened his door unto
the traveller: all this was true as far as the external act, and as
he then thought, with a proper temper of heart, Job could justify
himself before his fellow-sinners, Blind like himself; but when God
comes to deal with him, how different his views. Then it was,
'Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay my hand on
my mouth:' even with the very best there <!--Page 206--><a name=
"P206" id="P206"></a> is cause for this exercise, could we see
in the same light.</p>
<p>"How deceitful is the human heart; how unfaithful the
conscience; how little do we know of the sins of our daily walk. We
are called to watch and pray, that we enter not into temptation; to
walk with God in close, intimate communion: whether we eat or
drink, to do all to his glory: to consult him in all the affairs of
life, narrowly observing his providence in connection with our
circumstances; weighing all in his presence, requesting him to
determine our wills and direct our steps. We ought not to say, 'We
will go into such a city,' and do this or that; but, 'If the Lord
will.' How inconsistent our conduct with these rules. How often do
rashness, precipitation, and self-will accompany our determinations
and movements. And how often do His goodness and wisdom over rule
our folly, save us from our own pits, and prevent the evil that
might be expected. At no time does he deal with us as we sin,
though sometimes he stands by and allows us a taste of our folly:
then we are in trouble, we dig our pits and fall into them, but we
cannot deliver ourselves. O what a God! who, even at such a time,
says to us, 'Call on me in the time of trouble; I will deliver
thee, and thou shalt glorify my name; thou hast destroyed thyself,
but in me is Blessed help; mercy to pardon, goodness to wisdom to
guide, faithfulness to carry through and perfect what concerns us,
overruling our very follies, and causing them to teach us to
profit. This is God's way, according to many declarations of
himself in his word, and the experience of all his redeemed.</p>

wanting all this time, nor can it be that my children have been
negligent: no, no, I cannot suppose it. My children are in trouble;
they could not write that they were otherwise, and therefore remain
silent until they can write the issue. It is proper, and sure the
Lord feeds me with comfort. O the comfort of knowing that the
Almighty God is their own reconciled Father by an everlasting
covenant; Christ, the Mediator and Surety, their Advocate, Brother,
and Friend; the Holy Ghost their Teacher, Guide, and Comforter. It
cannot be ill with my dear children, who are also God's dear
children. My Father, I know it, thou chastenest for their profit. I
know not where they are, nor how they fare. I know not what to ask
for them; but thou art everywhere present, thine eye is upon them,
thou knowest all their wants, all their burdens, all their
bereavements, or whatever tries them. O let thy sensible presence
be with them; open wide the leaves of that new testament in
Christ's blood, and let them read their rich legacy, their
unsearchable riches in Christ; give them confidence in thy wisdom
and goodness, and sweet acquiescence in all thy dealings with them.

and the God of your seed. John the Baptist leaped in the womb when
the salutation of Mary sounded in his mother's ears; he was then a
living soul, and an heir of salvation at that moment. If your babe
was conceived in sin by the first covenant, he is an heir of grace
by the second. Think it not hard; no, you do not think it hard that
you have conceived him in sickness, carried him in sickness, and
suffered the pangs of birth without the succeeding joy to make you
forget your anguish. All this shall be for the glory of God, and
that is what you seek; believe it now, you shall see it soon. I do
sympathize; my fond heart had embraced a sweet babe added to the
family for one taken. The Lord has taken this also; it is his due:
I shall soon leave the mortal and join the immortal; five have
joined the head, six remain; and one I know nothing of, more than
that I cast him on the Lord, and look for mercy. I thank my God
that he gave you the grace of resignation, and supported you in the
solitary confinement. Alas, my child, did you listen for the voice
of your babe? O, what a suspense; but let me stop &mdash; he had
reached maturity ere that time; without the fight, obtained the
victory; he is of the travail of the Redeemer's soul; children are
God's heritage, the fruit of the womb his reward. Rest then in the
Lord; this is to his glory, both without and within your soul."</p>

&mdash; Here am I in my little room, surrounded with every comfort,
and as the provision of my God, I value all; but there lies the
chief, <!--Page 209--><a name="P209" id="P209"></a> <i>my
Bible</i>, the testament of my dying, risen, ascended, reigning
Saviour, bequeathing to me eternal life, executed in full, and made
as sure as the promise and oath of God. The influences of the Holy
Ghost on my mind, taking of the things of Christ, and showing them
unto me; opening wide the leaves of that new testament, in which I
read unsearchable riches, and my title to them sure: yes, sure,
even to me, a base idolatrous gentile, a rebel against the eternal
King, my Creator, Preserver, Provider; a backslider in heart and in
life. What has such a one to do with a holy God? He hath said only
return; and he himself hath turned to me, chastened, convinced,
restored, comforted. His ways are not as our ways, nor his
thoughts as our thoughts; but as the heavens are above the earth,
so are his ways above our ways, and his thoughts high above our
thoughts, and his plans above our conception. For although it is
for ever true, that he is of purer eyes than to behold evil, and
cannot look on iniquity; that his law has denounced a curse upon
the transgressor who keepeth it not in every jot and tittle; it is
for ever true, that this God is unchangeable in his nature and
purposes. What he hath said, that will he do. It is for ever true,
that I am all I have said, and worse, a sinner in heart, tongue,
and practice; yet am I a beloved child, a justified one, an heir of
God.</p>
<p>"Here is the testament, here is my charter with the seal of God
upon it &mdash; J<font size="-1">ESUS</font>, thou art the Secret
of the Lord; thou art the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the root and
offspring of David. Thou hast prevailed to open this book of
secrets, to loose the seven seals, and lay open its mysteries. Thou
Lamb of God, the appointed and anointed to the great work; in our
<!--Page 210--><a name="P210" id="P210"></a> room, and in our
nature, thou hast sustained the curse. Thou hast obeyed the law;
thou hast drunk the last drop of the last vial of that wrath which
would have sunk my soul in the endless depths of misery; and I
never could have expended one drop, but sunk deeper and deeper
under it. O not unto me, not unto ministers, not unto any creature
be the praise. As for me, I am, in a word, all that is vile in
myself; ministers, providences, afflictions are just what God makes
them; without his blessing they will not only pass without
profiting, but Satan and corruption will make them ministers to
themselves. Worthy is the Lamb that was slain, for he has redeemed
me with his blood. Worthy is the Lamb to receive power, and riches,
and wisdom, and strength, and honor, and glory, and blessing
&mdash; to him, to him alone, be the praise; who, of an heir of
hell, hath made an heir of heaven, by a substitutional
righteousness wrought out in his own person: mine by free gift, in
which I am completely justified. To this work let nothing be added,
with this work let nothing be mixed.</p>
<p>"There is another work going on by the same Spirit of truth;
also his purchase and gift &mdash; sanctification. In this I am
called to occupy, watch, strive, fight. Life is given; means of
support and growth provided; weapons of warfare &mdash; all things
necessary to life and godliness: these are promised to the diligent
use of means; and poverty, stagnation, discomfort threatened to the
indolent. O how sovereign and gracious has my God been in his
dealings with me in this respect also. For a sluggard have I been
in the days of youth and the prime of life; yet to me hath he given
the comforts promised only to the diligent. Here I sit on
<!--Page 211--><a name="P211" id="P211"></a> the verge of
threescore; my heart in some good measure loosened from the world,
although in full possession of it. Health, ease, plenty, elegance,
friendship, respectability; old age welcome, death unstung become a
familiar friend, the messenger of my Father to fetch me home to
those mansions which my Redeemer has taken possession of in my
name. My hope is strong for my offspring. Stately have been his
steps of mercy towards them already, and he saved them from their
mother's snares; he heard and answered my prayers, for his name's
sake, and overruled my practices; he is my God, and the God of my
children; the God of my children's children to the latest
generation; my cup is full of comfort, temporal and spiritual. O
praise him, praise him, for he is your God, and the God of your
offspring also."</p>

<p>"Mr. B&mdash;&mdash; was seized with the fever in its most malignant form;
for him every genius was exerted, and the medical store ransacked
for the healing balsam, but in vain. The Judge calls for the soul,
and the body must, at his command, dislodge its tenant; how awful,
if no surety was at hand, if he must stand naked &mdash; we know
the rest: did I say we know? O no. What can we know of that wrath
which in the garden of Gethsemane, when no murderous hand was near,
no high-priest, no council, or cross, wrung the blood through every
pore of the pure, the innocent Lamb of God, supported by Godhead.
If such things were done in the green tree, what shall be done in
the dry?"</p>
<p>Another of her grandchildren was shortly after removed by death;
his illness is noticed in the following meditation:</p>
<!--Page 214--><a name="P214" id="P214"></a><br />
<p class="right">"A<font size="-1">UGUST</font>, 1802.</p>
<p>"'And that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all, that
ye say, We will be as the heathen, as the families of the
countries, to serve wood and stone.' 'And I will bring you into the
wilderness, and there will I plead with you face to face: like as I
pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt,
so will I plead with you, saith the Lord God; and I will cause you
to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the
covenant.' 'And ye shall remember your ways, and all your doings,
wherein ye have been defiled; and ye shall loathe yourselves in
your own sight, for all your evils that ye have committed: and ye
shall know that I am the Lord, when I have wrought with you for my
name's sake, not according to your wicked ways, nor according to
your corrupt doings, O ye house of Israel, saith the Lord God.'
Ezek. 20:32, 35, 36, 43,&nbsp;44.</p>
<p>"It is good, yes, Lord, it is all good; too often have we said,
'we will be as the heathen, to serve wood and stone.' Often hast
thou chastened, often have we confessed, often resolved that we
would walk more softly, more tenderly, more circumspectly before
thee. But, alas, when thy hand is removed, when thou healest us,
and restorest to us health, comfort, and our pleasant things, we
wax fat and kick, nestle in our comfort, abuse thy gifts, and lose
sight of the giver. Alas, Lord, thus it must ever be with us, when
we keep not near to thee; we cannot walk one step alone without
stumbling. Thou knowest these naturally wicked hearts, that they
are deceitful above all things; they betray us before we are aware.
Blessed, ever blessed be our God for his well-ordered
<!--Page 215--><a name="P215" id="P215"></a> covenant. Blessed
for the discipline of it. O Lord, we are again in the wilderness,
and under thy chastising rod: for weeks past, we have 'eaten no
pleasant bread;' thy rod is still suspended over our pleasant, our
dear child; the streams of life ebb, he sickens, he dies, if thou
interfere not. But the issues of death are in thy hand, and our
eyes are towards thee. In vain are all means, all medicines, if
thou impart not the healing virtue. Thy weeping servants seek the
healing virtue from thy waters, thy seas, thy pure air. All nature
is in thy hand and ministers thy pleasure; to some conveying
health, to some disease. An herb to be boiled in simple milk, as
the figs for Hezekiah's boils, has been proposed, O let this prove
the appointed means, or direct and point out that which thou wilt
bless, and let our hearts and tongues give the glory to thee.</p>
<p>"We deserve this bereavement; but, Lord, what do we not deserve?
Even according to the constitution of the covenant of grace, and
consistent with thy pardoning, saving mercy, and all thy
long-suffering, wert thou to take vengeance on our inventions, by
exercising all thy threatened chastisements, should we ever be out
of the furnace? But even in this view, thou never hast dealt with
us as our iniquities deserved. 'He will not always chide, neither
will he keep his anger for ever.' Thou hast, in thousands of
instances, 'cast our sins behind thy back, into the midst of the
sea; blotted them out, to remember them no more for ever. Thy ways
are not as our ways, nor thy thoughts as our thoughts,' We may
plead, 'Deal not with us as we sin; but according to the multitude
of thy mercies blot out our transgressions. Pardon
<!--Page 216--><a name="P216" id="P216"></a> our iniquity, for
it is great.' Affliction is appointed, but it is 'in measure, when
it shooteth forth.' O debate with it, and according to thy promise,
'stay thy rough wind in the day of thine east wind.' Lord, say it
is enough, give the blessing, and by this measure shall iniquity be
purged, and the fruit be to take away sin. All means are alike in
thy hand, and any measure. In holy sovereignty and consummate
wisdom thou afflictest, and in thy hand afflictions yield the
peaceable fruits of righteousness: the hearts of thy people are
melted, and they sing of mercy and of judgment, and glorify thy
name. But, O Lord, a look, such as thou gavest to Peter, will melt
our hearts and restore our backsliding souls. The announcing of our
pardon by the same power, will make them overflow with love. If
thou but call us by name, as thou didst her who sought thee at thy
sepulchre, with the same power we shall recognize our Saviour and
worship him.</p>
<p>"O Lord our God, ever faithful to thy promises, thou hast said,
'Whatsoever ye ask in my name, believing that ye receive, I will do
it.' O Lord, I ask not the life of this child on this ground. I
have through life asked one thing of thee, and that will I seek to
obtain while life and breath remain, and reason and grace; I will
seek it, seek it with importunity, holding fast by thy promise to
do it, and believing that it shall be according to my petition.
Make good to me this thy promise, in a spiritual and eternal sense.
Be my God, and the God of my children, and of my children's
children, to the latest generation. Let my children according to
the flesh, be thine by regeneration of the Holy Ghost: it is a
great boon; <!--Page 217--><a name="P217" id="P217"></a> but
hast thou not said, 'Open thy mouth wide, I will fill it?' Father,
do as thou hast said: this is my one petition, and I cannot be said
nay. I ask for myself, my children, and my children's children, to
the latest generation, the life which Christ died to purchase, and
lives to bestow, that we may be made one with him, and our life hid
with him in God. Amen, and Amen.</p>
<p>"But, O my Father, thou hast said, 'Be careful for nothing; but
in every thing, by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let
your requests be made known unto God.' I ask, with submission to
thy holy will, if consistent with thy glory, his good, and the good
of the parents, the life of this child; that thou mayest spare him
for our comfort, but first for thine own glory; that thou mayest
give the different branches of this family a joyful meeting, a full
feast of grateful thanks to thee for all thy mercies; and our
hearts may rejoice before thee for the abundance of comfort.
Shouldst thou, in thy adorable wisdom, otherwise determine, thy
blessed and thy holy will be done. Wash the soul of this child in
the blood of Jesus, clothe him with thy righteousness, sanctify him
by thy Spirit, and fit him in every respect for thy kingdom. And O,
my divine Redeemer, I renew my petition which thou didst so
evidently grant in the case of our dear Isabella: take him in thine
arms of mercy; soften and shorten the parting pangs, and carry him
gently through the dark valley, and give him an abundant entrance
into thy heavenly kingdom, to join the hosannas of thy little
children, of whom thy kingdom is partly made up: and O, sanctify
the affliction to all concerned; direct our discipline
<!--Page 218--><a name="P218" id="P218"></a> according as thine
all-seeing, heart-searching eye sees we need; that it may bring
forth the peaceable fruits of righteousness, and 'the fruit of
affliction be to take away sin,' and the glory of all redound to
thee, Father, Son, and blessed Spirit. Amen, and Amen."</p>

<p>"Dear brother Pero,* happy brother Pero, thy Jesus, in whom thou
trustedst, has loosed thy bonds, has brought thee to that rest
which remains for the people of God; thou drinkest of the pure
river that maketh glad the city of our God; of that blessed
fountain from which issue all the streams which refresh and revive
us weary pilgrims. But a little while ago, and thou wast weary,
dark, and solitary; thy flesh fettering and clogging thy spirit;
thy God trying thy faith, hope, and patience, which he had
previously implanted, watered, and made vigorous, to stand that
trial more precious than gold that perisheth, though it be tried by
fire, and was made manifest to the glory of that Saviour who leaves
not his people <!--Page 222--><a name="P222" id="P222"></a> in
any case. If need be, they are in heaviness, through manifold
temptations; but he knows how to deliver them, having himself been
tempted.</p>
<p class="note">*Pero was an elderly man of color whom Mr. Andrew
Smith had purchased, and made free.<br />
&emsp;Pero had previously been a freed man of Christ. He had been
for some time in ill health; Mrs. Graham kindly attended on him,
and read the Scriptures to him: he died by the bursting of a
bloodvessel, at an hour when none of the family were with him. Mrs.
Graham, in humility of spirit, reproaches herself in this exercise,
for having been absent from him, without inquiring into his
situation for one hour.</p>
<p>"Thou hadst a taste of his cup: like him thou didst endure the
contradiction of sinners; like him thou didst experience the
desertion of friends, even thine old mistress, whom thou lately
didst esteem as a sister in Christ, and to whom thou didst look for
fresh communications from and through that written word, which she
could read and thou couldst not. Oh, how did she prove as a broken
reed unto thee; how did she neglect thy necessity, and her own
opportunity of bringing forth fruit in its season. Thou hast been
no loser. The Lord passed by the slothful servant, the unfaithful
steward, who neglected to give thee thy meat in due season, and
himself took her place; took thee from that household which was not
worthy of thee, and led thee to those mansions of bliss which
himself purchased and prepared; set thee at that table which shall
never be drawn, where thou shalt feast on all the fulness of God,
and drink of those pleasures which are at his right hand for
evermore. No need of old mistress now; no need of any earthly
vessel now, nor of that written word which thou didst so highly
prize. The Word made flesh has removed the veil that shaded the
glory of the God-man from thine eyes; flesh and blood could not
behold it; of this he has unclothed thee &mdash; left it with us to
look upon and mourn our sin. Thee he has introduced into the full
vision of eternal day, where thou knowest as thou art known, and
seest as thou art seen. O that full communion enjoyed between a
holy soul and the perfection of holiness! O that light of
<!--Page 223--><a name="P223" id="P223"></a> life, that ocean of
love, that inconceivable blessedness. How hast thou outrun us,
brother Pero; how distanced us in a moment. Oh, could I not watch
with thee one hour? Oh that I had received thy last blessing,
instead of which, conscious offence, deserved rebuke, painful
compunction wring my heart; and perhaps the rod of correction may
be suspended, and now ready to fall on my guilty head.</p>
<p>"Father, O my Father, am I not still thy child &mdash; still thy
adopted? Have not I an Advocate with thee, Jesus Christ the
righteous, whom thou hearest always? does not the blood of Christ
cleanse from all sin? yes, O yes. This is my universal remedy;
thousands and ten thousands of times have I experienced its
efficacy. Father, I again apply; blessed Spirit, do thine office.
Wash me, and I shall be clean; purge me, and I shall be whiter than
snow. I confess my sin, I acknowledge mine iniquity. Thou didst
bring to me an old disciple, near and dear to his and my Saviour;
thou didst require me to minister unto him all that he needed; the
honor was great, the opportunity valuable. Thou didst empty thy
servant for a time, thou didst hide his comfort, that I might,
through thy written word, draw living waters for him, and give him
to drink. O the honor; O the negligence. Thou didst send the call
for thy disciple to come up to thee; in thy providence thou didst
make it first known to me, that I might be instrumental in
conveying to him, through the same channel, oil and trimming for
his lamp. Great was the honor; dignified the service; but lost to
me for ever. I passed by on the other side. Blessed, blessed Jesus;
thou good Samaritan, who pouredst the oil and wine into his wounds,
and tookest him, not to an inn, <!--Page 224--><a name="P224" id=
"P224"></a> but to those mansions in the skies which thou, with
thine own blood, purchasedst for him; sanctify, O sanctify to me
this thy providence; pardon my neglect. Saviour, wash me in thy
blood, and sanctify and bring good out of even my transgression. By
thy grace, let it be a means of stirring me up to more
watchfulness, that I may meet the opportunities afforded me in thy
providence, to occupy till thou come."</p>

means proved ineffectual; the Lord refused the healing virtue. He
was brought to town to be near the physicians, but the Physician of
Israel aided them not. Disease increased; with pain, sickness,
convulsion, much he suffered, and long; he had a taste of the
bitterness of sin, but no part of the curse: <i>that</i> the

promises from the 22d verse to the end, for myself, for my
children, and for my children's children; for the church of God
throughout the world, in particular for this country, for Britain
and Ireland, France and Germany, where his name was once known, and
his gospel flourished. That the Lord would 'build the waste places
and repair the breaches;' that he would 'purify the sons of Levi,'
fill all pulpits with able, faithful ministers of the new
testament, who shall 'declare the whole counsel of God;' and that
wherever his name is recorded, the Holy Ghost might fill the place,
and convince the hearts of preachers and hearers, of sin, of
righteousness, and of judgment; might take of the things of Christ
and show unto them; and that the great Head of the church might
regulate and overrule all these breaches, differences, and shakings
in his churches.</p>
<p>"O Lord, I am ignorant; I know not the mind of the Spirit of
promise as thou knowest it. The promise of the fruit of the tree,
and the increase of the earth, of the corn, the wine, and the oil
is thine, as are all others. I am ignorant how far this refers to
spiritual prosperity, how far to temporal. I ask, O Lord, covenant
provision, the fruit of the seed sown in the hearts of men by thine
own Spirit; and that thou mayest build the ruined cities of thy
churches, and fill them 'with men like a flock, as the flock of
Jerusalem in her solemn feasts; so shall the waste cities be filled
with flocks of men, and they shall know that thou art the Lord.'
Thy fair, thy rich, thy beautiful creation is also the fruit of
grace. The wicked possess it, but <!--Page 226--><a name="P226" id=

thou, as a wise and merciful Father, givest them to possess
according as thy wisdom sees safe and good for them. When with the
things of this world they imbibe the spirit of the men of the
world; when they nestle in thy gifts and forget the Giver; when
they enjoy with a carnal spirit, and not with thankfulness and a
due sense of their dependence on thee as the God of providence as
well as of grace; thou, in mercy as in sovereignty, blastest their
pleasant things, mixest their cup of prosperity with wormwood and
gall, or sweepest all away with a turn of thy hand, that thou
mayest teach them that man doth not live by bread alone, but by
every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God; that thou
mayest withdraw them from sinful purposes, and hide pride from
them; that thou mayest open their ears to instruction, and seal it
on their hearts: thou dashest to pieces their broken cisterns, that
thou mayest lead them back to the fountain of living waters.</p>
<p>"It is good, O Lord, all good; I lay hold upon it: be thou the
provider of me and mine; feed us with food convenient for us. Thine
own word testifies that 'every creature of God is good, and nothing
is to be refused if it be received with thanksgiving, for it is
sanctified by the word of God and prayer.' I and the children for
whom I pray, possess many, yea, and abundance of temporal good
things. O Lord, give suitable grace, grace for grace. Spirit of
grace, keep us thankful, humble, dependent, spiritual; enable us to
receive all through a covenant channel, as the provision of our
Father by the way, through this wilderness. O may all be sanctified

that thou mightest purify to thyself a glorious church, 'not having
spot nor wrinkle, nor any such thing;' and shall not I be a
partaker? Art thou not made of God unto thy people, wisdom,
righteousness, sanctification, and redemption?</p>

strength and grace to help in every time of need.' Glory be to God,
Father, Son, and blessed Spirit, for the grace in which I stand.

several young ladies offered their services, which she thus
notices:</p>

<p>"A new thing is on the wheel in the city of New York. A society
of ladies, organized for the purpose of relieving widows with small
children, was new in this country. It is now, by the blessing of
God, apparently established. It was entered upon with prayer; it
has been conducted thus far with prayer. The blessing of God has
rested upon it, and much good has been done by it. Some of us have
looked long, and requested of God to open a way by which the
children of these widows might be instructed and taught to read his
word, and by his blessing on it, come to the knowledge of the way
of salvation. One means has been attempted of an ordinary kind:
twelve children were last week placed at school with Mrs. L&mdash;&mdash;, to
be <!--Page 230--><a name="P230" id="P230"></a> taught to read,
and some more are to be placed with another of our widows, for the
same purpose. But this indeed is new. A society of young ladies,
the first in rank in the city, in the very bloom of life, and full
of its prospects, engaged in those pleasures and amusements which
tend to engross the mind and shut out every idea unconnected with
them, coming forward and offering &mdash; not to contribute towards
a school, but their own personal attendance to instruct the
ignorant, O Lord, prosper their work. If this be of thee, it shall
prosper, and be productive of much good; but if thou bless not, it
will come to nothing but shame. No good can be done but by thee,
for there is none good but One;' and what are all thy creatures,
but instruments in thy hand, by which thou bringest to pass the
purposes of thy will? <i>Christians</i>, redeemed, enlightened,
sanctified, are no more; thou workest all their works in them; they
themselves are thy workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good
works, which thou hast prepared, that they should walk in them.
Worldlings also are thy instruments: by them thou workest and
bringest to pass the counsels of thy will; thou puttest into their
heart the good thing which thou workest, and girdest them for the
purpose: though not the children of thy covenant, they are the
instruments of thy providence.</p>
<p>"O Lord, take up this matter; gird these young women to this
very purpose, and prosper them in the art of teaching these orphans
of thy providence. And Oh, Lord, hear my more important petition. I
am not worthy to be heard. O Lord, I am not worthy to be named in
connection with any good done by thee. I am the chief of sinners,
the chief of backsliders; every <!--Page 231--><a name="P231" id=
"P231"></a> thing in me, of me, or by me, is vile as far as it
is mine. All that is otherwise, all good implanted in me, or done
by me, is thine own; it is grace, free grace, the purchase of thine
own Anointed, my dear Redeemer, my dying, risen, ascended Saviour,
and the fruit of the Holy Ghost, the sent of the Father and of the
Son, to set up a kingdom of righteousness in the hearts of the
redeemed. Let me, as a sinner saved by grace, to whom thou hast
been pleased to give the exceeding great and precious promises
&mdash; let me, under the sprinkling of the blood of the covenant,
and in entire dependence on my surety-righteousness &mdash; let me
draw near and present my petition, in the name and for the sake of
Him whom thou hearest always. O Lord God Almighty, by this very
thing, build up thy Zion. Lay hold of these young creatures, and
while they are in the way of thy providence, bring them to the
house of our master's brethren. O thou great Teacher, teach thou
teacher and taught. Be found of them who seek thee not, and say
with power, 'Behold me, behold me,' to a people not yet called by
thy name, and out of this small thing in thy providence, bring
revenues of praise to thy name as the God of grace.&emsp;Amen.</p>
<p>"And now, O Lord, for myself, I pray for deep humility; I ask,
for His sake who was meek and lowly, to be kept where my place
really is, at the feet of all thy servants; and if it be thy
pleasure to make me a useful instrument, in proportion make me a
humble soul. Let me ever remember my ways and be ashamed, and never
open my mouth any more because of my shame, when thou art pacified
towards me for all that I have done. O keep me in this contrite
frame of <!--Page 232--><a name="P232" id="P232"></a> mind. In
all that to which thou callest me, give me a willing heart, and
furnish me with every necessary for thy glory. And now prepare me
to speak to these young women good and acceptable words. Save me
from sacrificing truth, or departing, in any respect, from
Christian duty; give me such wisdom as maybe suited to the
occasion: in all things mine eyes are to the Lord; from thee let my
fruit be found."</p>
<br />
<p class="right">"F<font size="-1">EBRUARY</font> 17, 1804.</p>
<p>"Saturday, the 11th, twenty-nine young ladies met with Mrs.
Hoffman and myself, at Mr. O. Hoffman's, Wall-street, on purpose to
receive instructions respecting the school; and having paired
themselves according to their mind, I delivered what I had prepared
for them: they all seemed hearty in their engagement; and on
Monday, the 13th inst., Miss L&mdash;&mdash;t and Miss L&mdash;&mdash;n attended at the
school-room and commenced teaching thirteen children; four have
been added since.</p>
<p>"Again, O Lord, let me request thy blessing on this institution;
put thy seal upon it, and mark it for thine own. Gird the teachers
for their work, and open the minds of the scholars to instruction.
And O, Lord, in thine own time, and by means of thine own devising,
provide spiritual instruction for teachers and taught. Is it thy
pleasure, Lord, that I attend the children on a day appointed for
the purpose? Wilt thou accept of me as an instrument by which thou
wilt do good to the souls of these children; and wilt thou keep me
humble and contrite in my own soul? Bless also Mrs. L&mdash;&mdash;'s school;
there too let thy work appear; deal with her soul as 'thou dealest
with thy chosen;' teach her the way of salvation, and make her a
teacher by <!--Page 233--><a name="P233" id="P233"></a> thine
own Spirit. If it be my dear Master's pleasure to use me, I would
also attend that school as his instrument. 'Search me, O Lord, and
know my heart; try me, and know my thoughts; and see if there be
any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.'"</p>
<p>Mrs. Graham's address to the young ladies, above alluded to, is
given as a specimen of the appropriateness of her addresses on
similar occasions, and as an incentive to kindred exertions in
every condition of life.</p>
<br />
<p>"M<font size="-1">Y DEAR YOUNG</font> L<font size=
"-1">ADIES</font> &mdash; Every thing new becomes matter of
speculation and variety of opinion.</p>
<p>"An association of ladies for the relief of destitute widows and
orphans, was a new thing in this country. It was feeble in its
origin, the jest of most, the ridicule of many, and it met the
opposition of not a few. The men could not allow our sex the
steadiness and perseverance necessary to establish such an
undertaking. But God put <i>his</i> seal upon it; and under his
fostering care it has prospered beyond the most sanguine
expectations of its propagators. Its fame is spread over the United
States, and celebrated in foreign countries. It has been a
precedent to many cities, who have followed the laudable example.
This fame is not more brilliant than just. The hungry are fed, the
naked are clothed, shelter is provided for the outcasts, medicine
and cordials for the sick, and the soothing voice of sympathy
cheers the disconsolate. Who are the authors of all these
blessings? Your mothers, ladies, the benevolent members of this so
justly famed Society. But who are these children that
<!--Page 234--><a name="P234" id="P234"></a> idly ramble through
the streets, a prey to growing depravity and vicious example? hark,
they <i>quarrel</i>, they <i>swear</i>, and such no doubt will
<i>lie</i> and <i>steal</i>. And that group of dear little
creatures, running about in the most imminent danger, apparently
without protection, are they under the care of this so justly famed
society? They are; they are fed, they are clothed, their mother's
fireside is made warm for them; but no culture is provided for
their minds, nor protection from baneful example. These will in
time follow that of the older ones, and grow up the slaves of
idleness and vice, the certain road to ruin.</p>
<p>"Alas, alas, and is there no help &mdash; no preventive? Yes,
there is. Behold the angelic band; hail, ye virtuous daughters;
worthy of your virtuous mothers, come forward and tread in their
steps. Snatch these little ones from the whirling vortex; bring
them to a place of safety; teach them to know their Father, God:
tell them of their Saviour's love; lead them through the history of
his life; mark to them the example he set, the precepts he recorded
for their observance, and the promises for their comfort. And by
teaching them to read, enable them to retrace all your instructions
when their eyes see you no more.</p>
<p>"My dear young ladies, the sacrifice you have made shall most
assuredly meet its reward: but like your mothers, you will
experience much painful banter, you will be styled school-madams.
Let it pass; suffer it quietly; when your scheme begins to ripen
and the fruits appear, who shall be able to withhold their praise?
Only be steadfast, draw not back and justify the prophecies of
many.</p>
<!--Page 235--><a name="P235" id="P235"></a>
<p>"A great general, in ancient times, in search of glory, landed
his troops on the hostile coast, and then burnt all his ships: they
must conquer, or die. You have, ladies, already embarked in this
design; there is no remaining neuter now; your name and undertaking
are in every mouth; you must press forward and justify your cause:
and justified it shall be, if you persevere; it cannot be
otherwise. The benevolence you contemplate is as superior to that
already in operation, as the interest of the soul is to that of the
body; and it is your own &mdash; the very scheme originated in a
young mind in this company. The society were contemplating
mercenary agents, schools for pay, and one is already
established.</p>
<p>"But this labor of love; who could have hoped for it? A society
of <i>young ladies,</i> in rank the first in the city, in the very
bloom of life, and full of its prospects, engaged in those
pleasures and amusements which generally engross the mind, and shut
out every idea unconnected with self, coming forward and offering
&mdash; what? not their purses, that were <i>trash;</i> but their
own personal services to instruct the ignorant, and become the
saviors of many of their sex. It is indeed a new thing, and more
strange in this age of dissipation than that institution from which
it sprung. May this too become the darling of Providence. May God
put his seal upon this also. May he bless and prosper you in this
undertaking, bless you, and make you a blessing."</p>
<p>We next have her wrestling supplications for the revival of
God's work in the church with which she was connected.</p>
<br />
<!--Page 236--><a name="P236" id="P236"></a>
<p class="right">"F<font size="-1">EBRUARY</font> 21, 1804.</p>
<p>"O Thou, who art Alpha and Omega, the first and the last, who
holdest the seven stars in thy right hand, and walkest in the midst
of the seven golden candle-sticks, who livest and was dead, and art
alive for evermore. Amen. And hast the keys of hell and of death.
Out of thy mouth goeth a sharp twoedged sword, by which thou
reachest the hearts of the most hardened. O write with power, speak
with power, in the heart of the angel of this church. Hast thou not
in former days had thy dwelling among them? in days of trouble
didst thou not work in them the fruits of labor and patience, so
that for thy name's sake they labored and fainted not? Thou
blessedst them and gave them peace, and they rejoiced in the light
of thy countenance; thou multipliedst them also, so that from a
handful they became <i>two bands</i>. Alas, Lord, we have,
Jeshurun-like, 'waxed fat and kicked;' we have left our first love;
we have not watched and prayed, as thou gavest commandment, and
thou hast left us to enter into temptation; we have forsaken the
counsel of our old men, and given heed to flatterers; we have
forgotten our dependence on thee, and said, 'Ashur shall save us,
we will ride upon horses.' We have set up our idols in our hearts,
and put the stumbling-block of our iniquity before our eyes; we
have taken counsel, but not of thee, and covered ourselves with a
covering, but not of thy Spirit; we have gloried in our own wisdom,
and strengthened ourselves in our own strength.</p>
<p>"We are poor, and blind, and miserable, and naked; rich in our
fancied wisdom, seeing by our own light, and compassing ourselves
about with our own <!--Page 237--><a name="P237" id="P237"></a>
sparks; we feed on ashes: a deceived heart has turned us aside.</p>
<p>"'O Lord, the hope of Israel, and the Saviour thereof.' It is of
the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed. To us belong shame and
confusion of face &mdash; O cover us with it &mdash; but to thee
belongs mercy. Humble us, O Lord, and we shall be humbled; 'turn
us, and we shall be turned.'</p>
<p>"It is in our nature to backslide for ever; thou, and thou only,
knowest the deceitfulness of the heart; thou, and thou only, canst
search it. O search us, and try us, and show us what wicked ways
there are in us, and lead us in the way everlasting. Deal not with
us according to our sins, but according to the multitude of thine
own mercies. We have no other plea; our sins call for judgment, and
until thou, thine own blessed self, turn us, we are in no situation
to receive mercy. Work with us for thy name's sake, establish with
us thine own covenant of free, unmerited, undeserved mercy. Then
shall we know that thou art the Lord.</p>
<p>"Make us thine by thine own covenant, established in Christ,
thine own anointed; the blessed surety, by thine own appointment;
our substitute, on whom it hath pleased thee to lay the iniquities
of us all; in whose sacred person thou tookest vengeance for all
our sins; by whom thy law is fulfilled, magnified, and made
honorable; whose doing and suffering in our stead is accepted by
Jehovah. 'The Lord is well pleased for his righteousness' sake.' No
covenant short of one fulfilled in every jot and tittle could
benefit us.</p>
<p>"Thy covenant is well-ordered in all things, and it is sure.</p>
<!--Page 238--><a name="P238" id="P238"></a>
<p>"Here, O Lord, I take my stand; here I lay my foundation, and on
this thy covenant I build; or rather, here thou thyself hast laid
my foundation, and on this rock hast thou set my soul and built my
hopes, thou subduing my enmity. I acquiesce. I will now 'remember
the years of thy hand,' look back to thy dealings with thine own
nation, whom thou didst choose and set apart from all other
nations, though of the same blood with all those that dwell on the
face of the whole earth.</p>
<p>"They, like us, destroyed themselves, but in thee was their
help. They also sinned, committed iniquity, and did wickedly; they
remembered not thy mercy, but provoked thee at the Red sea, after
the great deliverance thou hadst wrought for them, and the wonders
thou madest to pass before them in the land of Egypt. Nevertheless
thou savedst them for thy name's sake, that thou mightest make thy
mighty power known; thou didst repeat thy wonders, and didst dry up
the sea before them. He fed them with corn from heaven; they did
eat angel's food. He clave the rock in the wilderness, and caused
waters to run down like a river. After all, they forsook the God of
their mercies; they believed not his promises, nor trusted in his
salvation; they lusted, and they murmured, and desired to turn back
to Egypt. Thou didst chasten them sore for their sin, and didst
bring down their heart with grief.</p>
<p>"When thou didst slay them, they sought thee, and remembered
that God was their rock, and the most high God their Redeemer.
Nevertheless they did flatter with their mouth and lied unto thee
with their tongue, for their heart was not right with thee,
<!--Page 239--><a name="P239" id="P239"></a> neither were they
steadfast in thy covenant. But thou being full of compassion,
forgavest their iniquity and destroyedst them not; yea, many a time
turnedst thou away thine anger, and didst not stir up all thy
wrath.</p>
<p>"O how many times did they turn back, tempted God, and limited
the Holy One of Israel. Yet did he fulfil all his promises, and by
wonders in the sea, wonders in the desert, wonders in Zoan's field,
and in the camps of their enemies, he led them safely to the border
of his sanctuary, to the mountain which his right hand had
purchased. He cast out the heathen before them, and gave them rest
in the land of promise. Even there they provoked the Most High,
provoked him to jealousy with their graven images.</p>
<p>"Again thou didst chasten them sore, let loose the corruptions
of men upon them, and suffer them to fall before their enemies.
Thou deliveredst thy strength into captivity, and thy glory into
the hands of their enemies.</p>
<p>"Yet, O Lord, again didst thou deliver them, and sentest
provision for them by thine own covenant. Thou didst choose David
thy servant, and take him from the sheep-folds. Thou broughtest him
to feed Jacob thy people, and Israel thine inheritance. So he fed
them according to the integrity of his heart, and guided them by
the skilfulness of his hands.</p>
<p>"Such are the people with whom thou hast still to do. Such, O
God of infinite mercy, such the God with whom we sinners have to
do, even 'the Lord God, merciful and gracious, keeping mercy for
thou sands, forgiving iniquity, transgression, and sin; and that
will by no means clear the guilty.' O what <!--Page 240--><a name=
"P240" id="P240"></a> could man or angel have done with this
last character of thy name? Thy covenant makes provision. In Christ
Jesus, our blessed substitute, all is reconciled. Thy name is one;
the just God, and the justifier of the ungodly who believe in
Jesus; This God is our God; we will make mention of his
righteousness, and his only. By his own covenant, in his own time,
and by means of his own providing, he will revive
us.&emsp;Amen."</p>
<br />
<p class="right">"A<font size="-1">PRIL</font>, 1804</p>
<p>"All my desire is before thee, and it is all contained in thy
well-ordered covenant. Many years of vanity, of idolatry, of
backsliding, wandering, and folly have passed over my head since I
first took hold of thy covenant. How fickle, false, and deceitful
have I proved; yet thou knowest, thine own Spirit through all my
wanderings testified in my heart, that out of the channel of this
covenant there could be neither safety nor comfort; and never, so
far as I can remember, have I deliberately chosen to be dealt with
by any other. Its corrections and chastisements have reached the
deepest sensibilities of my heart. Thine arrows stuck fast in me,
thy hand pressed me sore; there was no soundness in my flesh,
neither rest in my bones, because of my sin; mine iniquities went
over my head, were a burden too heavy to bear. I was feeble and
sore broken, and roared by reason of the disquiet of my heart. My
lovers and friends stood aloof from my sore, and my kinsmen stood
afar off. I was ready to halt, and my sorrow was continually before
me; yet even in my darkest, deepest afflictions, when deep called
to deep, and thy waves and billows were passing over me; when my
soul seemed <!--Page 241--><a name="P241" id="P241"></a> sinking
in the mire where there was no standing, I groped in the dark; my
heart panted, my strength failed, and the light of mine eyes seemed
gone out. I was weak with my groaning; in the night I made my bed
to swim with my tears; yet even then, by that same covenant by
which I was suffering, light sprang out of darkness, glimmering
hope in the midst of despair. I remembered the years of thy right
hand; in the multitude of my thoughts within me &mdash; the
provision made in this covenant &mdash; thy comforts delighted my
soul.</p>
<p>"I was furnished with a plea which would condemn, by every
covenant but thine: Pardon my iniquities, for they are great. Thou,
even thou, art he who blottest out transgressions as a cloud, and
iniquity as a thick cloud. Verily thou art a God that pardoneth,
though thou takest vengeance on the inventions of thy rebellious
children. 'Vengeance!' not the vengeance of the curse; no, that, O
thou blessed Covenant, thou blessed Surety, that fell on thy
devoted head. Thou by this covenant wast 'made a curse for us.'
Thou didst tread the wine-press alone, and of the people there was
none to help thee. Thou didst expend the last drop of that cup of
vengeance. Every cup put into our hand, though a cup of trembling,
is a cup of blessing. I this day take a fresh hold of thy covenant,
for myself, for my children, and for my children's children, to the
latest generation. For my brother and sister, for their children,
and children's children; for the near concerns of our dear D. B&mdash;&mdash;;
and for all whom I carry on my mind to thy throne of grace. This is
the sum and substance of my prayers. Bring them into the bond of
this covenant, and deal with them according to the order
<!--Page 242--><a name="P242" id="P242"></a> of it, and the
provision made for them in it, in all possible
circumstances.&emsp;Amen.</p>
<p>"O God, in the multitude of thy mercies hear me, in the truth of
thy salvation. Truth of thy salvation! thou only knowest the truth
of thy salvation. How little do we know of thy work. Many of those
providences which appear to us dark and dismal, are wheels turning
round 'the truth of thy salvation;' opening our blinded eyes to the
issues of sin, and also delivering from the snares of the devil.
Deal not, O Lord, with me, and mine, as our iniquities deserve;
this has never been thy way with us; but according to thy former
loving-kindness, and to all the long-suffering, patience, and
pardoning mercy which thy aged servant has experienced through her
sinful guilty pilgrimage. Thou hast forgiven me all the way from
Egypt. Leave me not now, when I am old and grey-headed; but when
strength and heart fail, be thou the strength of my heart and
portion for ever.&emsp;Amen."</p>
<p>The winter of 1804-5 was unusually severe: the river Hudson was
shut by frost as early as November; fuel was consequently scarce
and dear, and the poor suffered greatly. Mrs. Graham visited those
parts of the city where the poorer class of sufferers dwelt;* in
upwards of two hundred families she either found a
<!--Page 243--><a name="P243" id="P243"></a> Bible their
property, or gave them one; praying with them in their affliction.
She requested a friend to write, first one religious tract and then
another, suited <!--Page 244--><a name="P244" id="P244"></a> to
the peculiar situation of those afflicted people. One was called,
"A Donation to Poor Widows with Small Children;" the other, "A
Second Visit to Poor Widows with Small Children." And lest it might
be said it was cheap to give advice, she usually gave a small sum
of money along with the tracts she distributed. There was at this
time neither a Bible nor Tract Society in New York. Mrs. Hoffman
accompanied her in many of her excursions. In the course of their
visits, they discovered a French family from St. Domingo in such
extremity of distress as made them judge it necessary to report
their case to the Honorable Dewitt Clinton, then mayor of the city.
The situation of this family being made public, three hundred
dollars were voluntarily contributed for their relief. Roused by
this incident, a public meeting was called at the Tontine
Coffee-house, and committees from the different wards were
appointed to aid the corporation in ascertaining and supplying the
immediate wants of the suffering poor. The zeal of Mrs. Graham and
Mrs. Hoffman paved the way for this public-spirited exertion, which
probably was the means of saving the lives of some of the destitute
and friendless.</p>

but much affected with the death of the amiable youth M&mdash;&mdash;, and
the melancholy situation of his bereaved parents.</p>
<p>"The epidemic spreads over the city in every direction among the
few remaining in it. All the public offices are here; crowds of the
citizens, and houses and stores spring up in a day; all is bustle
and confusion, and all seem mad on business.</p>
<p>"Parting with my dear friend was most painful, so painful that
nothing could alleviate it but the presence of my own children,
who, could there have been room from deeper sorrows, would have
shared it with me. O that I could put my God in my place in your
heart. What are earthly friends? How few are steady against all
change of circumstances; of these, fewer still have it in their
power to supply every link of friendship's chain; a thousand
unforeseen incidents disappoint their wishes and frustrate their
hopes, rendering abortive their greatest exertions. But there is a
Friend, everywhere present, thoroughly acquainted with every
circumstance of the heart and of the life; all-powerful to relieve;
whose love is invariable, and ever the most tender when every other
friend stands aloof; a friend in adversity, 'a friend who sticketh
closer than a brother,' whose love surpasseth the
<!--Page 246--><a name="P246" id="P246"></a> love of women. This
Friend receiveth sinners &mdash; casts out none who come to him. He
was never known to disappoint the hopes of any poor sinner. He
receives them into his heart; he takes all their burdens and cares
on himself, pays all their debts, answers all demands against them,
and is every way surety for them; they become his own, no one has
any thing to say to them but himself. He knows them &mdash; how apt
to err, to wander, yea, to forget him, and prove ungrateful; all
this he knows, but he has made provision for all. He has a rod, and
he will subdue their iniquities. He will heal their backslidings,
he will bring back and restore his wanderers. He will in due time
perfect what concerns them, and present them to his Father
purified, without spot or wrinkle.</p>
<p>"In the meantime he requires them to confide in him; to go up
through this wilderness leaning upon him; to tell him all their
complaints and griefs, and to comfort themselves: and he will
impress the comfort by means of his great and precious promises,
scattered like so many pearls through his sacred Bible, tabled
there on purpose for us to ground our prayers upon, and delight
ourselves in. This is your friend's Friend, and of ten thousand
besides. This was the wicked Magdalene's Friend; this, the
persecuting Paul's Friend, wicked Manasseh's Friend; the
adulterous, murdering David's Friend. And he is your Friend, though
your eyes are holden that you see him not. He is leading you by a
way that you know not. This is one of his characters, 'I will bring
the blind by a way that they know not.'</p>
<p>"I was happy to find your niece was to return with Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;;
but, my dear, a painful dread has assaulted <!--Page 247--><a name=
"P247" id="P247"></a> my peace, lest Satan get the advantage by
means of a stranger in the family, and undo what has been begun.
The world may have peace without God; but you shall not. You have,
however feebly, taken hold of his covenant, and he will keep you to
your choice. 'If his children forsake his laws and go astray,' etc.
Psalm&nbsp;79:30."</p>

<p>"M<font size="-1">Y DEAR</font> F<font size="-1">RIEND</font>
&mdash; This is not our rest; through much tribulation all Christ's
disciples must follow him. There is a rest prepared for the people
of God: as far as tasted in this world &mdash; and in this world it
is tasted &mdash; it consists in a mind resigned to the will of God
in proportion as it can say, 'Thy will be done on earth, as it is
done in heaven.' Christ himself was made perfect through suffering,
and all his followers shall be so in their appointed measure. What
is our cup to his? O my dear friend, we are ransomed, we are
redeemed, and we are fitting and preparing for the purchased
inheritance, that perfect rest prepared for the people of God when
their warfare is finished. Let him do all his pleasure with us
here; let him subdue our iniquities in his own way; let him glorify
his name by our sufferings &mdash; his glory is ever connected with
his people's best interests. We shall one day acknowledge that he
has done all things well, and that not one word of all that he has
promised has failed.</p>
<p>"It has pleased the Lord to take from us our dear sweet Rebecca;
young as she was, through much tribulation she entered in: I have
scarcely seen severer suffering, nor a harder dismission. It is
well; the Lord will answer his own ends by it for the good of all
concerned, as well as for his own glory. Our dear G&mdash;&mdash;
<!--Page 248--><a name="P248" id="P248"></a> was ill at the same
time, and all hope was lost as to him also; for a whole week we
looked upon him as dying, A bold measure was taken with him, which
succeeded; the Lord had commanded life; it was not thought of for
her. God had appointed to her entrance into life eternal. It is all
well. Blessed, blessed be his name; for her he has taken and him he
has restored, both equally. I.G. S&mdash;&mdash; was confined at the same
time with a broken arm; N. B&mdash;&mdash; with the fever and pleurisy. Deep
have been the wounds in this aged heart, not yet weaned from earth,
but tremblingly alive to every thing that concerns my children. Yet
I do give up. I have asked but one thing with importunity, and by
that I abide. I did not ask for temporal life, but the life which
Christ died to purchase, and lives to bestow; let him answer my
petition by means of his own appointing: by health or by sickness,
by riches or by poverty, by long life or early deaths &mdash; only
let all mine by the ties of nature, be his by regeneration of his
Spirit."</p>
<p>Having felt the trials and the responsibilities of widowhood,
she wrote to her brother's widow, Mrs. Marshall, in 1805:</p>
<p>"You are now, my dear sister, the only head of your family. Will
you take Joshua's determination? 'As for me and my house, we will
serve the Lord.' Take hold of God's covenant for your orphan
children as for yourself, and consider them as his, to be brought
up for him. Be a priestess in your own house, and keep up the
worship of God daily in your family, and confess your Lord and
Master before angels, men, and devils. Those who thus honor God, he
will honor.</p>
<!--Page 249--><a name="P249" id="P249"></a>
<p>"You are indeed, my dear, arrived at an important stage of your
journey through this great wilderness. You are now the head of the
family, and are to God immediately answerable. No earthly
consideration must make you give up the government of it, nor the
prerogative which he hath given you, to counsel, and even beseech
your household to serve the Lord. You cannot give grace; you cannot
give life; and where there is no life there can be no spiritual
exercise: but you may use means, although there is much prudence to
be observed to avoid disgust.</p>
<p>"Be faithful, then, my dear sister, to your important trust. See
that your household remember the Sabbath-day to keep it holy; your
children, of course, will accompany you to the house of God, but
let not your servants absent themselves from his ordinances, and
endeavor, on your return home, to explain and bring home the word
that may have been spoken to their consciences. Above all, let it
be your constant aim to set before them a godly, consistent
example, and be much engaged in prayer for them &mdash; I mean for
your servants as well as for your children, and God will, in all
probability, make you a mother in Israel, the mother of many
spiritual children, and turn your captivity into rejoicing, and
fill your mouth with songs of praise; or should you not have this
comfort, should the night of adversity last to the very valley of
the shadow of death, the morning of eternal rest shall then beam
forth upon your own soul, and your prayers may be answered for
others, when the eyes that wept and the breast that heaved are at
rest in the dust. O, then, my sister, possess your soul in
patience, and seek to make daily advances in holiness."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>
<h4>ORPHAN ASYLUM SOCIETY &mdash; FOREIGN MISSIONARIES &mdash;
LETTERS.</h4>
<br />
<p>O<font size="-1">N</font> the 15th of March, 1806, the female
subscribers to proposals for providing an asylum for orphan
children met at the City Hotel; Mrs. Graham was called to the
chair, a society organized, and a board of direction chosen, Mrs.
Hoffman was elected the first directress of the Orphan Asylum
Society. Mrs. Graham continued in the office of first directress of
the Widows' Society, but took a deep interest in the success of the
Orphan Asylum also; she, or one of her family, taught the orphans
daily, until the funds of the institution were sufficient to
provide a teacher and superintendent. She was a trustee at the time
of her decease. The wish to establish this new society was
occasioned by the pain which it gave the ladies of the Widows'
Society to behold a family of orphans driven, on the decease of a
widow, to seek refuge in the almshouse; no melting heart to feel,
no redeeming hand to rescue them from a situation so unpromising
for mental and moral improvement.</p>
<p>"Among the afflicted of our suffering race," thus speaks the
constitution of the society, "none makes a stronger or more
impressive appeal to humanity than the <i>destitute orphan</i>.
Crime has not been the cause of its misery, and future usefulness
may yet be the result of its protection; the reverse is often the
case of more aged objects. God himself has marked the fatherless as
the peculiar subjects of his divine compassion. 'A
<!--Page 251--><a name="P251" id="P251"></a> Father of the
fatherless is God in his holy habitation,' 'When my father and my
mother forsake me, then the Lord will take me up.' To be the
blessed instrument of, divine Providence in making good the promise
of God, is a privilege equally desirable and honorable to the
benevolent heart.'"</p>
<p>And truly God has made good his promise towards this benevolent
institution. He has crowned the undertaking with his remarkable
blessing. It was begun by his disciples in faith, and he has
acknowledged them in it. Having for fourteen months occupied a
hired house for an asylum, the ladies entertained the bold idea of
building an asylum on account of the society. They had then about
three hundred and fifty dollars as the commencement of a fund for
the building; they purchased four lots of ground in the village of
Greenwich, on a healthful, elevated site, possessing a fine
prospect. The corner-stone was laid on the 7th of July, 1807. They
erected a building fifty feet square; from time to time they
proceeded to finish the interior of the building, and to purchase
additional ground as their funds would permit; and such was the
liberality of the legislature and of the public, that the society
soon possessed a handsome building and nearly an acre of ground,
all of which must have cost them little short of twenty-five
thousand dollars. In that house Mrs. Graham and Mrs. Hoffman spent
much of their time; there they trained for eternity the children of
those whose widowed dying mothers they had cheered with the hope
that when they should be taken away, God would fulfil his gracious
promise and preserve their fatherless children alive.</p>
<!--Page 252--><a name="P252" id="P252"></a>
<p>Mrs. Hoffman survived Mrs. Graham seven years. Her end, like
that of her friend, was peace. But though God removed those mothers
in Israel, their prayers are still before him, and the institution
continues to prosper. In 1836, the city having extended to where
the asylum was situated, and the property at the same time
increased in value, the society became desirous to remove where the
children would enjoy purer air, and have greater convenience for a
garden and pasture for cows. With the advice of their patrons, they
sold the property for about thirty-nine thousand dollars; purchased
nearly ten acres of ground at Bloomingdale, and on the 9th of June
the same year laid the foundation-stone of their present beautiful
building.</p>
<p>In the Thirty-fourth Annual Report of the society for 1840, we
find the following record of God's goodness:</p>
<p>"On no former occasion has the board of direction been
privileged to make to the friends and patrons of this institution a
more favorable report than the present. The orphan's home is
completed, and the beautiful building on the banks of the Hudson is
alike an ornament to the city and a memorial of the liberality of
its inhabitants. Within it are found, not only ample accommodations
for a numerous family, but a place for the Lord, a habitation for
the orphans' God. On the 19th of November last the chapel was
opened for religious worship; the services were performed by
reverend clergy of different denominations; and a highly
respectable and apparently gratified audience attended. All the
children, one hundred and sixty-five in number, were present, from
the infant in arms <!--Page 253--><a name="P253" id="P253"></a>
to the youth who will this day pronounce the valedictory.</p>
<p>"To those who have witnessed the progress of this institution
from the <i>small frame-house</i> of 1806 to the noble edifice of
1840, accompanied by the recollection that the door has never been
closed against the destitute orphan, how deep must be the
conviction of an overruling Providence &mdash; the truth of the
declaration, that God is the father of the fatherless in his holy
habitation, and the fulfilment of his gracious promise, 'Leave thy
fatherless children, I will preserve them alive.' Nor is the orphan
family merely furnished with sufficient accommodation for dwelling
and moral and religious education: the grounds afford ample room
for exercise and recreation; the garden supplies them with fruit
and vegetables; and there being pasture for several cows, wholesome
milk is added to their simple breakfast, while the abounding river
invigorates the frame by a saline bath, and by casting a net into
it, furnishes an occasional dinner of fresh fish."</p>
<p>The society, ever grateful to the founders, have erected a
tablet on the wall of the beautiful chapel, which bears the
following inscription:</p>
<!--Page 254--><a name="P254" id="P254"></a><br />
<p class="center"><b>Sacred to the Memory</b><br />
<font size="-2">OF</font><br />

<font size="-2">WHO DIE IN THE LORD:</font><br />
<font size="-1">THEIR WORKS DO FOLLOW THEM.</font><br />
<br /></p>
<p>The success which has attended the Orphan Asylum Society,
furnishes strong encouragement to attempt great and good objects
even with slender means. God in his providence will command a
blessing on exertions of this character. It is too common a
mistake, and one fatal to the progress of improvement, that great
means should be in actual possession before great objects should be
attempted. Ah, were our dependence simply on apparent instruments,
how small must be our hopes of success. There is a mystery,
<!--Page 255--><a name="P255" id="P255"></a> yet a certainty, in
the manner by which God is pleased in his providence to conduct
feeble means to a happy conclusion. Has he not preserved,
cherished, and blessed his church through many ages, amidst
overwhelming persecutions, and that often by means apparently
inadequate to this end? We must work for, as well as pray for the
blessing which God has promised to bestow on our sinful race. We
must put our shoulder to the wheel, while we look up to heaven for
assistance, and God will bless those who are found in the path of
duty.</p>
<p>In this asylum, the ladies have set no limits to the number to
be received; and it has pleased God also not to set limits to the
means necessary for their support. The institution is a great
favorite with the public, and is frequently visited by strangers,
who are delighted with the cleanliness, health, and cheerful
countenances of the orphans.</p>
<p>The Society have received a charter of incorporation from the
legislature; they have a handsome seal, with this inscription:
"Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these, ye
have done it unto me."</p>
<p>For several years it was customary with Mrs. Graham to visit the
New York hospital; and before the admirable provision since made
for the separate care of those mentally deranged, she paid a
particular attention to patients of this description.</p>
<p>To the apartments appropriated to sick female convicts in the
state prison, she also made many visits; she met with some
affecting circumstances among this class.</p>
<p>In the winter of 1807-8, when the suspension of commerce by the
embargo rendered the situation of the <!--Page 256--><a name="P256"
id="P256"></a> poor more destitute than ever, Mrs. Graham
adopted a plan best calculated in her view to detect the idle
applicant for charity, and at the same time to furnish employment
for the more worthy among the female poor. She purchased flax, and
lent wheels where applicants had none. Such as were industrious,
took the work with thankfulness and were paid for it; those who
were beggars by profession never kept their word by returning for
the flax or the wheel. The flax thus spun was afterwards wove,
bleached, and made into table-cloths and towels for family use.</p>
<p>Mrs. Graham used to remark, that until some institution should
be formed to furnish employment for industrious poor women, the
work of charity would be incomplete. It was about this time that,
deeming the duties too laborious for her health, she resigned the
office of first directress of the Widows' Society, and took the
place of a manager. She afterwards declined this also, and became a
trustee of the Orphan Asylum Society, as more suited to her
advanced period of life.</p>
<p>The lady to whom the following letter was addressed was Miss
F<font size="-1">ARQUHARSON</font>, a person of genuine piety and
worth, whom Mrs. Graham had educated and prepared to become her
assistant in teaching. When Mrs. Graham retired from her school,
Miss Farquharson declined to succeed her, preferring to accompany
and enjoy the society of her patroness and friend. Until 1804 she
proved as efficient an assistant to Mrs. Graham in her charitable
labors in the Widows' Society and Sabbath-school, as she had been
in her boarding-school.</p>
<p>During the prevalence of the yellow-fever in 1804,
<!--Page 257--><a name="P257" id="P257"></a> she was called to
attend her own dying mother, and underwent so much fatigue, that on
her return to Mrs. Graham she broke a bloodvessel, and for four
months was confined to her room, during all which time Mrs. Graham
attended her night and day. Her medical attendants prescribed a
long voyage and residence in a hot climate as the only means of
saving her life. About that time Mr. Andrew Smith was preparing to
sail for the East Indies with his family, by the way of England.
With them she embarked. She sojourned several weeks in Birmingham,
and there the circumstances commenced which eventually led Miss
Farquharson to become a missionary's wife, and the first American
missionary to foreign lands. Her history has been published by Rev.
Mr. Knill, in a tract entitled, "The Missionary's Wife."</p>
<p>The London Missionary Society were preparing to establish a
mission in the idolatrous city of Surat, but the East India Company
would not allow Christian missionaries to sail in their ships. The
Society thankfully availed themselves of the privilege of sending
Mr. Loveless and Dr. Taylor in the American ship Alleghany. They
arrived in Madras, June, 1805.</p>
<p>During the voyage an attachment was formed between Mr. Loveless
and Miss Farquharson which death only could sever, and introduced
her to scenes of usefulness for more than thirty years, for which
she was eminently qualified by early training. As soon as Mrs.
Graham heard how her friend was going to be employed, she wrote to
her as follows:</p>
<p>"M<font size="-1">Y DEAR</font> S<font size="-1">ALLY</font>
&mdash; Many tears have I shed over your letter. What a changing
lot has been that of my family! The Lord's providences to me and
mine have <!--Page 258--><a name="P258" id="P258"></a> not been
of the ordinary kind, and you, as one in it, seem to be a partaker
with us. Surely, of all others, we have most reason to say, We are
strangers and pilgrims on the earth. Oh that we may drink into the
true spirit of that phrase, and enjoy the genuine, firm faith of an
everlasting habitation, of living at home with God.</p>
<p>"My dear Sally, take the comfort of this, that it is the Lord
who hath led you all the way by which you have gone. Of all persons
whom I know, you were, from your temper and disposition, the least
likely to travel, still less to continue a traveller. No ordinary
means would have led you to leave your friends and religious
privileges. And many a pang it has cost me, on reflection, to think
how positive I was that you should take the voyage. But it was of
the Lord. The physicians urged it as the only chance you had for
life, and they had reason; for of all those who were attacked in
the same manner, there is not one alive, within my knowledge, at
this day.</p>
<p>"The Lord, by wonderful means, called you from your native land,
and led you to the very spot where you met Mr. Loveless. The same
God, being also his God, led him, by means perhaps equally
unforeseen and uncommon, to the same spot, united your hearts to
each other, and made you one in his hand, and I trust to his glory.
You ask my blessing: I have carried both of you to my God and
Saviour, and have prayed, and continue to pray, that the Lord will
bless you individually and unitedly, give you much sweet communion
with himself, and much social enjoyment with him and with one
another. May he bless Mr. Loveless as a missionary, and give him
the spirit of <!--Page 259--><a name="P259" id="P259"></a> his
office, and much fruit among the heathen, as seals to his ministry;
and may you be a helper with him, and both be blessed and made a
blessing.</p>
<p>"I feel my loss. You were a comfort and a help to us all,
especially to me: but I do not mourn; I heartily acquiesce. This is
not only agreeable to me, as it is one of God's wise arrangements
to you and us all, but I think it will be more to your comfort.
Religion and conjugal love will sweeten almost any lot. It is the
Lord's appointment and his richest earthly blessing.</p>
<p>"My dear Sally, I have ever considered you as my child. You are
very dear to my heart. Tell Mr. Loveless he must ever consider me
as his mother.</p>
<p class="center">"Your affectionate mother,</p>
<p class="right">"I<font size="-1">SABELLA</font> G<font size=

<br />
<p>In the month of January, 1807, the London Missionary Society, of
which Mr. Bethune was a foreign director, sent to this country the
Rev. Messrs. Gordon, Lee, and Morrison; the two first to sail in an
American ship for the East Indies, and Mr. Morrison for China.
These devoted missionaries shared largely in the hospitalities of
Christians in New York, and spent much of their time with Mr.
Bethune's family. Mrs. Graham took great delight in conversing and
advising with them, and though none of her letters addressed to
them have come to hand, it is believed she corresponded with them.
The following extract of a letter from Dr. Morrison, indicates the
respect and Christian affection with which he regarded her.</p>

passed through waters deep as the fathomless ocean which I crossed;
but with the Lord there is mercy; with him is 'plenteous
redemption.' He is ready to forgive. He has restored to me, in some
measure, 'the joy of his salvation,' and will not, I trust, take
his Holy Spirit from me. This is my prayer. To-day he enabled me,

disobedience: among whom also we all <!--Page 262--><a name="P262"
id="P262"></a> had our conversation in times past, in the lusts
of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind;
and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others. But God,
who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us,
even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with
Christ; by grace are ye saved, through faith, not of works, lest
any man should boast.' Works there are, my Juliet, most assuredly;
every quickened soul will live, and bring forth fruits of
righteousness; but these works are not attainable but in God's way
and order. It follows, 'For we are his workmanship, created in
Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that
we should walk in them.'</p>
<p>"My Juliet says, 'To you then I look up to teach me.' Let me
then bring you to the great Teacher and Prophet of the church,
without whose teaching all human instruction will be ineffectual.
We read of two amiable characters coming to Christ professedly for
instruction. The first you will find in Matthew 19:16. The young
man asks him, 'What good thing shall I do, that I may inherit
eternal life?' Jesus answers him by referring him to the moral law:
the young man, not made acquainted by the Spirit of God, either
with the extent or spirituality of that law, or of the depravity of
his own nature, answers, as many in like circumstances still do,'
All these things have I kept from my youth up.' I do not suppose
any one could contradict him. It is added that Jesus loved him, and
he was a person of attractive character; but Jesus knew that the
true principle was not there &mdash; supreme love to God, 'with all
the heart, with all the soul, with all the strength, and with all
the mind:' <!--Page 263--><a name="P263" id="P263"></a>
therefore he gave him a test which proved that the world was
uppermost in his heart. He went away sorrowful, and we hear no more
of him.</p>
<p>"Of the other person we read in that remarkable chapter, the
third of John's gospel &mdash; Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews, and
also a teacher. Well knew he the law, as to the letter of it, both
moral and ceremonial; he must also have been acquainted with all
the Old Testament scripture types and prophecies, it being his
office to expound; and no doubt, among others, was looking for the
promised Messiah. Jesus does not send him to either the law or the
prophets. This ruler comes with a conviction and an acknowledgment
that Jesus himself was a teacher immediately from God; and Jesus
immediately takes upon himself his great office, and begins with
urging that which is a sinner's first business &mdash; 'to know
himself,' what he is by nature, and the necessity of the new birth.
Nicodemus, with all his learning, was a stranger to this doctrine:
'How can a man be born when he is old?' Jesus repeats his doctrine,
'He must be born of water and the Spirit;' baptized with water and
the Holy Ghost. 'That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that
which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I said unto
you, Ye must be born again.' Humble that proud reason that will
believe nothing but what it can understand. 'The wind bloweth where
it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell
whence it cometh or whither it goeth; so is every one that is born
of the Spirit.' A mystery it is; nevertheless it is true.</p>
<p>"Follow out the chapter, my dear: Jesus preaches his own gospel,
and brings in that beautiful type, the <!--Page 264--><a name=
"P264" id="P264"></a> serpent, which he had commanded to be
raised on a pole, that those who had been bitten with fiery
serpents, whose bite was death, should look upon it and be healed.
Read it, my dear, in the 21st of Numbers; and in reference to this,
he himself says, 'Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of
the earth.' Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom
of God. Quickened, renewed in the spirit, of his mind, old things
pass away and all things become new &mdash; new principles, new
desires, new pleasures, new ends. The work is God's. The whole plan
of redemption is his from first to last. It is clearly revealed in
Scripture, and there is no dispute among Christians concerning it.
The fall of man, his corruption and depravity; his state under the
curse of a broken covenant, and his exposure to eternal misery; his
helplessness and total inability to gain acceptance with God; his
ignorance of himself &mdash; 'dead in trespasses and sins,'
'without God and without hope in the world:' this is his situation
by nature. But there is good news proclaimed: 'God so loved the
world that he gave his only begotten Son,' to become the surety of
lost sinners. He took our nature upon him, our sins upon him, our
duties upon him: he was placed in our stead; sustained the penalty
of the broken law; fulfilled its utmost demands; redeemed us; gave
us a new covenant, of which himself is the surety: and there is 'no
condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus.'</p>
<p>"The merits of Christ, exclusive of any thing of ours, are the
sole foundation of our hope. Christ is set forth, in Scripture, as
the atonement, the propitiation for sins, the one sacrifice for
sin; Christ is the <!--Page 265--><a name="P265" id="P265"></a>
end of the law for righteousness; all is made ours by free gift.
1&nbsp;John, 5:11. All is ready, justice satisfied, God reconciled,
peace proclaimed. But what is all this to a thoughtless world,
insensible of their situation, danger, and need? It is an awful
saying, but it is of the Holy Ghost, If our gospel be hid, it is
hid to them that are lost, in whom the god of this world hath
blinded their minds, and darkened their understandings, and
hardened their hearts, etc. Therefore the application of this grace
is also of God; it is all within his plan; he has appointed means,
and commanded our diligence in the use of them. We have his Bible
in our hands, his ministers in our churches, who are also pastors
and teachers if we apply for their aid in private; we have a throne
of grace to go to, and many great and precious promises held up in
God's word for us to embrace and plead for Christ's sake: we have
many prayers in the Scriptures which we may adopt.</p>
<p>"I acknowledge we are all still dependent for the effect; that
must be from God himself. But he does honor his own ordinances. He
puts forth his power, and convinces of sin; this is his first work.
The soul is awakened, aroused, convinced of sin and misery; sins of
the heart, sins of the tongue, sins of the life, press upon the
conscience which never disturbed us before; misspent time, wasted
talents, lost opportunities, neglect of God's word and ordinances,
so that the soul cannot rest. O, my Juliet, this is a hopeful case.
I hope you have experienced something of this. It is one of the
surest marks of the operation of the Spirit of God, and a prelude
to the new birth. It never takes place without it, for the whole
need not <!--Page 266--><a name="P266" id="P266"></a> a
physician, but they that are sick. Only the weary and heavy laden
will prize rest, and Christ is the rest they need; only a convinced
sinner will or can prize the Saviour, and now the Lord opens his
mind to understand the Scriptures. He sees the provision which God
has made for ruined sinners, by providing a substitute to stand in
his room; he perceives how God can be just and justify the sinner
who takes shelter in Jesus; he falls in with God's gracious plan:
receives the Lord Jesus as God's gift to sinners; trusts entirely
in his merits for pardon, peace, reconciliation, and eternal life;
resigns his soul into the hands of his Saviour, in the faith that
he will save it, and devotes himself unreservedly to his service,
in the faith that he will give him grace to live to him in all holy
obedience. Now, and not till now, according to God's promise, he
receives power to become his child; this is God's order, John 1:12.
Now he receives life and begins to live; but there is yet a great
work before him. It hath pleased God in his plan to finish at once
a justifying righteousness; it is his own work, and was finished in
that awful hour when he announced it in his last words on the
cross. John 19:30. To this nothing of ours is to be added, with
this nothing of ours mixed; it is for ever perfect, it is God's
gift made ours in the hour when we first believe, receive it, rest
our souls upon it.</p>
<p>"But it hath not pleased God in this plan to deliver the
believer at once from indwelling sin. This is the subject of the
Christian warfare, the race, the good fight. Now the believer
receives life, and is called to work. 'Work out your own salvation
with fear and trembling, for it is God that worketh in you
<!--Page 267--><a name="P267" id="P267"></a> both to will and to
do.' All the promises in this blessed Bible are his, they are yea
and amen in Christ; Christ himself is his; his Spirit dwells in
him. The believer is united to Jesus by as real a union as the
branch to the vine, the members to the head, the building with the
foundation. Yet sin dwelleth in him, and is to be expunged by
constant applications to Christ in prayer; by means of watching,
striving, fighting &mdash; fighting under his banner. In his
blessed word we are informed where our strength lies, what our
weapons, what our armor. But what can I say on those subjects? the
whole word of God is on the subject of redemption; to this refer
the whole labors of Christ's ministers, and the whole dispensation
of God's providence.</p>
<p>"Are these things so? My Juliet, this is not the doctrine of any
one church. About these subjects there is no dispute.
Presbyterians, Episcopalians, Baptists, Independents, all agree in
these great things. And are these things so indeed? O, my Juliet,
where is the time to be spared for plays, assemblies, and such
numerous idle parties of various descriptions? I must stop; the
subject is great, and we have many excellent treatises on the
various parts of it, by able, pious men. It would be improper to
crowd it thus into a letter, unless to instigate to further
investigation.</p>
<p>"Farewell; I ever am, my dear Juliet,</p>

<br />
<p>The delicate state of health to which one of her granddaughters
was reduced in 1808, made it necessary for her to spend the summer
season for five successive <!--Page 268--><a name="P268" id=
"P268"></a> years at Rockaway, Long Island, for the advantage of
sea-bathing. Mrs. Graham went with her, it being beneficial to her
own health also. In this place she met with many strangers; the
company residing there treated her with much affection and respect.
She always attended to the worship of God morning and evening in
her room, and was usually accompanied by some of the ladies who
boarded in the house. Her fund of information, vivacity of manner,
and the interest which she felt in the happiness of all around her,
made her society highly valued and pleasing. Few of those ladies
who stayed with her at Rockaway for any length of time, failed to
express, at parting, their esteem for her, and they generally added
a pressing invitation for a visit from her, if ever she should
travel near where they dwelt.</p>
<p>The following is one of her sweet meditations while at
Rockaway:</p>
<br />
<p class="right">"R<font size="-1">OCKAWAY</font>, August,

<p>"Sweet health again returns, which, considering the agitation of
my mind, surprises me; but it is the Lord's pleasure. I did not
wish to recover. I was in hopes the Lord was about to deliver me
from 'this body of sin and death.' Lord, reconcile me to thy most
holy will. Health is certainly a great blessing. I feel its
sweetness. O make me thankful. Great and numerous are my mercies.
Every thing pleasant and every thing necessary to life, to
godliness, is mine: food and raiment to the utmost desires of
nature; the beauties of thy fair creation surround my ordinary
dwelling; my dear little room, my Bible, and books of every
virtuous kind &mdash; by grace, thy chief mercy, I desire no other
&mdash; and by the kindness of my children, <!--Page 269--><a name=
"P269" id="P269"></a> I possess all as if they were my own
personal property. By thy wonderful loving-kindness, thou hast
given me, instead of the contempt which I have merited, the love
and esteem of thy people, and thou hast made the very stones of the
field to be at peace with me, so that wherever I go I meet with
kindness."</p>

gives a thrill to my old heart; in a moment the various scenes of
my youthful days rise before me &mdash; the old mansion itself, and
all its beloved inmates, every one of whom have now crossed the
Jordan of death, leaving me a solitary wanderer in this weary
wilderness. Ah, I can at this moment think of spots, by the
burnside and the braeside, endeared to my heart by a thousand
tender associations. There have I wandered with my beloved,
idolized husband, and there has he delighted my heart with
professions of love. These were indeed moments of ecstasy; but
hush, there are you a widow with very, very different sensations,
and here am I a widow with sensations equally different. The Lord
has showed us many and sore adversities, but he will bring us up
from the deeps below; we are much nearer our Father's house, and I
hope proportionably riper for those joys which are at his right
hand; and although your letter has brought some pleasing
recollections to my mind &mdash; days of love and courtship, days,
some of solitude, some of disappointment, some of ecstasy &mdash;
yet I find they were all days of idolatry, therefore to be mourned
over, not retasted, re&euml;njoyed with delight. No, no; Father,
forgive me."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X.</h3>
<h4>NEW YORK BIBLE SOCIETY &mdash; ASSOCIATIONS FOR PRAYER &mdash;
HAPPY OLD AGE &mdash; LETTERS.</h4>
<p>"I<font size="-1">N</font> December, 1809, a Bible Society was
organized in New York, and about the same time twenty respectable
persons united in a society, to wait on the Lord, to know what
their hands could find to do to promote his glory, to advance his
kingdom, to spread the savor of the Redeemer's name, or in any way
to benefit the souls of their fellow-sinners.</p>
<p>"On Monday a meeting for prayer was instituted in Hetty-street,
and another in Mulberry-street, with which the Presbyterian
ministers have agreed to meet in rotation. It is the Lord. We have
heard of revivals all around, but feared lest the aggravated sins
of New York might provoke the Lord to pass by, leaving our fleece
dry, while the dew wet all around. Great have been our privileges;
the gospel trumpet has sounded in every corner of our city. The
Lord's servants have set before us life and death, assuring us,
from God's word, that 'though hand join in hand, the wicked shall
not go unpunished;' beseeching us to flee from the wrath to come,
and lay hold on the hope set before us. God in his providence has
visited us with mercies and with judgments: stricken us, and healed
us; scattered us, and gathered us: but alas, alas, we were 'eating
and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage.' Many, very many,
wasting their time, health, and substance, in all manner of
immorality, <!--Page 271--><a name="P271" id="P271"></a> and our
rulers caring for none of these things; yea, many of them
practising the same things; and Oh, God's own saved people sitting
still, restraining testimony before men and prayer before God. What
were we to expect but that God should say, Why should they be
stricken any more? they will revolt more and more: they are joined
to idols; let them alone. Such, O Lord, would be the case didst
thou not deliver us out of our own self-destroying snares. If thou
turn us not, we shall never turn; it is in our nature to backslide
for ever.</p>
<p>"But is not the time come to pass when before thy people call
thou answerest, and while they are yet speaking, thou hearest? Art
thou not calling with power, 'Return, ye backsliding children, and
I will heal your backslidings?' and hast thou not prepared their
hearts to answer, Behold, we come unto thee, for thou art the Lord
our God? truly, in vain is salvation looked for from the hills, and
from the multitude of mountains; truly, from the Lord our God is
the salvation of Israel. Hast thou not, O God, prepared the hearts
of thy people to pray, and thine ear to hear? Is not this Bible
Society, and are not these associations for prayer, tokens from
thee for good? More and more, Lord, may thy people give thee no
rest, until thou make Zion a praise in the earth. O the Hope of
Israel, and the Saviour thereof, be not as a wayfaring man, that
turneth aside for a night. May thy people constrain thee to abide
with us for ever, to form us a people for thyself, to show forth
thy praise.</p>
<p>"I have just conveyed dear Mrs. A&mdash;&mdash;le to the confines of the
eternal world. I trust the dear Redeemer <!--Page 272--><a name=
"P272" id="P272"></a> received her spirit. I have a good hope
that she is now in possession of the mansion purchased and prepared
for her by that dear Saviour whose name she professed, and I think,
in an humble, steady, quiet way, faithfully followed. She loved the
word of God, the house of God, the people of God. She spoke little,
but said she had a good hope: asked me to read the Bible different
times, and also to pray; said the invitations of the gospel were
sweet to her: observed that the Lord had been very merciful to her
in her affliction.</p>
<p>"A few hours before her death she desired me to read that
hymn,</p>
<p class="center"><font size="-1">"'To him that loved the souls of
men,' etc,</font></p>
<p>Also,</p>
<p class="center"><font size="-1">"'Come, let us join our cheerful
songs,' etc.</font></p>
<p>She asked if I thought she would continue long. I said, No, my
dear, you will very soon be with Jesus; and encouraged her as the
Lord enabled me. She repeated the question some time after, and I
gave her the same answer. She then said, 'This night?' I answered,
Yes, my love, this night. She bowed her head with a sweet smile,
laid it in a reclining posture, and set herself to wait with
patience the Lord's time. She was very much oppressed, and breathed
with much difficulty. Some time after she asked me to pray, which I
did, and begged that the Lord would increase her faith and
patience, and, if according to his will, give her a gentle passage
and an abundant entrance. In a short time her breathing became
short and low; she shut her eyes and gently breathed weaker and
weaker, till her God delivered her without motion or groan. I was
on my knees praying. I then thanked God for his goodness in this
sweet dismission; prayed <!--Page 273--><a name="P273" id=
"P273"></a> for the husband, the children, the two young men
present, and us all, gave glory to God, and rose to watch to future
duty.</p>
<p>"O my God, is not my own death at hand? It is a hard battle. My
Jesus, thou knowest the struggle. I too must drink of this cup; mix
it for me, my Redeemer. O let a full sense of free pardon, the
recollection of the great and precious promises, a bright view of
the joys at God's right hand, as the fruit of thy death, be applied
to my soul in that awful hour. Holy Spirit, pour in the oil and
wine of thy consolations in that trying hour. O let me not be
straitened. Open wide to my soul the leaves of that well-ordered
covenant, of which Christ himself is the sum and substance.
Redeeming God, may I experience proof in that solemn hour, that
'thy flesh is meat indeed, and thy blood is drink indeed.' O feed
me with this living food; may I feel life spring up in my soul, and
be assured that I shall 'never die.' O my God, grant one more
request. Open my lips, and let them, as well as my heart, be filled
with the high praises of my redeeming God.</p>
<p>"I know I am unworthy; the vilest of the vile; but magnify thy
grace. I have much forgiven; O let my heart burn with love and
gratitude in that hour, and my lips utter its effusions in songs of
praise.&emsp;Amen.</p>
<p>"When the short thick breathing comes, and the slow fetches,
sealing up speech and expelling the spirit from its abode, O let me
hear or understand thee saying unto me, 'It is I, be not
afraid.'"</p>
<br />
<p class="right">"J<font size="-1">ANUARY</font>, 1810.</p>
<p>"'Come and let us return unto the Lord, for he hath torn, and he
will heal us; he hath smitten, and <!--Page 274--><a name="P274"
id="P274"></a> he will bind us up. After two days will he revive
us, in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his
sight.'</p>
<p>"O Lord, turn us and we shall be turned, draw us and we will run
after thee. Revive us, and we shall live in thy sight. Thou must
ever be first. It is in our nature to backslide for ever: and
whenever we see a backslider restored, or a rebel lay down the
weapons of rebellion, <i>there</i> we may trace thy footsteps, O
God of grace.</p>
<p>"No external providence will touch our hard, our deceitful
hearts. All that goes under the name of misfortune will but drive
us <i>from</i> thee, never <i>to</i> thee, till thou teach us to
profit, and lead us by the way that we should go. Thou callest,
'Return, ye backsliding children, and I will heal your
backslidings;' but we have been foolish, sottish children, without
understanding, wise to do evil, but to do good having no
knowledge.</p>
<p>"Let the days come when the children of America &mdash; the
earth is the Lord's &mdash; shall 'come with weeping, and seek the
Lord their God;' when 'they shall ask the way to Zion, with their
faces thitherward;' when they shall come, saying, 'Let us join
ourselves to the Lord in a perpetual covenant, never to be
forgotten.' O the Hope of Israel and Saviour thereof, is not that
day and that time come? Hast thou not been working on the right
hand and on the left? Thou hast given us pastors according to thine
own heart, who feed us with knowledge and understanding: and thou
art here and there proving thy gospel thy power and thy wisdom, to
the salvation of sinners; casting down the imaginations of pride,
and bringing all into subjection to thy Son Jesus.</p>
<!--Page 275--><a name="P275" id="P275"></a>
<p>"O pour out the spirit of grace and supplication, upon thy
living members, that they may wrestle with thee, and not let thee
go until thou bless us, until thou make this 'cloud like a man's
hand' cover our heavens with blackness, and issue in a plentiful
rain. O pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods on the dry
ground; thy Spirit upon our seed, and thy blessing upon our
offspring. O Lord, hast thou not said that thou wilt do it, and
that they shall spring up as among the grass, and as willows by the
water-courses. One shall say, I am the Lord's, another shall call
himself by the name of Jacob, and another shall subscribe with his
hand unto the Lord, and surname himself by the name of Israel.
Amen, O our God, Amen.</p>
<p>"Last week the Lord's young servant, Mr. R&mdash;&mdash;, received to the
communion of the church seven adults, Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash; and her two
daughters, Dr. H&mdash;&mdash; and sister, Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;, and a black woman,
servant to Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;. It was a glorious sight, and revived the
hearts of God's people who witnessed it. O God of grace, grant that
the fruits of righteousness may prove that they are broken off from
the wild olive-tree, and grafted into thee, thou living and
life-giving olive-tree; from thee must their fruit be found. O
cause them to bring forth much fruit. Herein is the Father
glorified, that they bear much fruit; so shall they be Christ's
disciples, and attain to the assurance of that happy state. Father,
glorify thy name.&emsp;Amen."</p>
<p>In the year 1810, while bathing at Rockaway, she was carried by
the surf beyond her depth, and for some time there was scarcely a
hope of her regaining <!--Page 276--><a name="P276" id=
"P276"></a> the shore. Her grandchildren were weeping on the
beach, and the company assembled there were afflicted but hopeless
spectators of her danger. At that moment of peril she prayed to the
Lord for deliverance, but acquiesced in his will, if he should see
fit to take her to himself in this manner. Able to swim a little,
she kept herself afloat for some time: she became at length very
faint; and when her friends on the beach apprehended her lost, they
perceived that the waves had impelled her somewhat nearer to them.
A gentleman present, and her female attendant, stepped into the
surf and extending their arms for mutual support, one of them was
enabled to lay hold on Mrs. Graham's bathing-gown and to pull her
towards them. When they brought her ashore she was much exhausted,
and had swallowed a considerable quantity of water. It was some
hours before she revived, when she addressed the company in a very
serious and impressive manner that affected them to tears. Her
health during the following winter was much impaired by the shock
it had received.</p>
<br />
<p class="right">"R<font size="-1">OCKAWAY</font>, June 15,
1810.</p>
<p>"Came here the first of the month, with the children in the
whooping-cough. No 'church-going bell' here, but the Lord is
everywhere; and I have found him here, warming my heart with
gratitude and contrition, and drawing it out in prayer for his
people met to worship in his sanctuary.</p>
<p>"When at a distance from my own people, it has been my practice
to join with whatever class of professing Christians might be near
me. Here it has been with the Methodists, who, I believe, enjoy
communion with God. Yesterday I went to a meeting
<!--Page 277--><a name="P277" id="P277"></a> of &mdash;&mdash;, who lay
great stress on good morals; but, O my God, what could I do, shut
up with them? Without the finished work of my Saviour, I could have
no hope; without his law-fulfilling righteousness, I must stand a
law-condemned sinner.</p>
<p>"The preacher yesterday took no text; in the course of his
sermon he said the Scriptures were only secondary guides. He began
with the importance of thinking of death, and said it could not be
possible for a rational being to live carelessly, with thoughts of
death and eternity in view. Is it so? No; we see sinners die, under
the full conviction that they are dying, as thoughtless as they
have lived.</p>
<p>"He said, that by constantly attending to the motions of the
Spirit and complying with them, Christians arrived at a state of
perfection even here; and brought in that text, 'He that is born of
God cannot sin,' etc. Spoke highly of watchfulness, and avoiding
connection with the world; said a real Christian could not hold any
office of power among men. Paul held one, but he gave it up when he
became an apostle. Christ's kingdom was not of this world. Laws and
officers were necessary among the men of the world, but not among
Christians. Spoke of the cross of Christ as consisting in suffering
and self-denial. His blood was the Spirit which cleansed from all
sin, by delivering all who obeyed him from its power. He named not
my blessed Saviour, except when he had occasion to mention some of
his moral sayings. He said, indeed, that he was the Light that
lightened every man that came into the world, and the condemnation
was that men would not receive it; but one word of his blessed
priesthood he spoke not, but said <!--Page 278--><a name="P278" id=
"P278"></a> we were in a state of probation, and every one would
be judged according to his works, taking into view the advantages
he had enjoyed; recommended the reading of the Scriptures,
especially the inspired books, the New Testament and the prophets;
for it needed no inspiration to write the national history of the
Jews more than that of any other nation. Said the Scriptures were
good secondary guides, and contained excellent lessons and
truths.</p>
<p>"When I was coming away he offered me his hand, saying that I
was not a resident there. I answered no, I was separated from my
own people, but wished to unite with any class of Christians who
met professedly to worship God; but confessed I could not live upon
what he had this day delivered. He asked what was wrong. I
answered, he had given some good exhortations; I agreed with him in
many things respecting conduct; but I missed the foundation. He
repeated the scriptures, 'Other foundation can no man lay,' etc. I
said, Exactly: off this foundation there is no salvation; on this
foundation there may be loss, but no condemnation. We have a great
and merciful High-priest, who can have compassion on the ignorant,
and them who are out of the way; and there may be straw, hay,
stubble, which will be burnt up, but the soul itself, being on the
foundation, is safe. He said with firmness, That will be burnt up
in this world; without holiness no man shall see the Lord. I said,
True; but why avoid the tenor of Scripture? read all the epistles;
the Lord Jesus Christ, the gift of God, the propitiatory sacrifice,
the meritorious law-fulfilling righteousness, is set forth, in
every one of them, as that which saves from wrath and entitles
<!--Page 279--><a name="P279" id="P279"></a> to eternal life. He
said they were all emblems of our being made holy in heart and
life; Christians were baptized unto the death of Christ, and rise
with him to newness of life, buried with him, etc. I granted that
as one reading of these words. He said every other view was shadow.
I said, No &mdash; the blood of bulls and goats is shadow; Christ
himself, his person, his offices, his life, his sufferings, his
death, his burial, resurrection, ascension, and intercession within
the veil, are all substance &mdash; the sole foundation of my hope,
and my only plea at a throne of grace.</p>

<p class="right">"R<font size="-1">OCKAWAY</font>, August, 1810</p>
<p>"Hebrews is my ordinary, when no other passage of Scripture
attracts my particular attention. This is the third morning I have
opened the New Testament on the 14th chapter of John, and have fed
delightfully on the first three verses. There is at all times a
thorn in my heart, keeping me in continual remembrance of my vile,
ungrateful backslidings, so that I eat my sweetest morsels with
bitter herbs. It was particularly painful to me this morning;
nevertheless; the Lord God, merciful and gracious, repeated on my
heart, 'Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.'
I was arrested at the fourth verse, 'Whither I go ye know, and the
way ye know.' I have <!--Page 280--><a name="P280" id=
"P280"></a> had many comfortable exercises on the eighth verse,
the Redeemer's answer to Philip's inquiry. But this morning my mind
was led to a different view of that saying, and which I think was
literally included. The Redeemer was going to his Father, and his
way lay through death, the death of the cross. The hour was at hand
when he was to make his holy and righteous soul an offering for
sin, that he might become the author of salvation to all who obey
him. All the sins confessed and pardoned by the sacrifices under
the law were laid on this blessed Surety &mdash; they were only the
shadows, he was the substance &mdash; the real Lamb of God which
taketh away the sin of the world, was now to be offered up. This
was he who said, 'Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a
body hast thou prepared me; in burnt-offerings and offerings for
sin thou hast had no pleasure; then said I, Lo, I come to do thy
will, O God:' by which will we are sanctified through the offering
of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</p>
<p>"He was going to the garden &mdash; Oh that garden! Peter had
said he was able to drink of that cup and to be baptized with that
baptism. Ah no, Peter; that exceeding sorrow in the garden, when no
visible hand was upon him, was a cup the least drop of which would
have overwhelmed the strongest angel. No strength short of
omnipotent could have sustained that hour and power of darkness. It
was not the scourge, the thorns, the nails, nor the last pangs of
dissolution; through all these he was as a lamb led to the
slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers, dumb. It was a
mysterious horror, of which no created being can have any
conception. It was this that <!--Page 281--><a name="P281" id=
"P281"></a> wrung the great drops of blood through every pore of
his sacred body &mdash; this that extorted the agonizing prayer,
'Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me;' and again,
in his last moments on the cross, 'My God, my God, why hast thou
forsaken me?' Blessed, for ever blessed be our Jehovah Jesus, who
said, 'Not my will, but thine be done.' The will of God was done,
and he said, 'It is finished,' and gave up the ghost.</p>
<p>"All his people must follow him by the way of death; nearly all
his disciples followed by the death of the cross, and many others
after them, supported by his almighty grace, rejoiced that they
were counted worthy to suffer for his sake; but they drank not of
that cup.</p>
<p>"Some of his people, for holy and wise purposes, have had a
taste in the hiding of God's face, but no curse; that he himself
drank to the last drop: He trod the wine-press alone, and of the
people there was none with him. By his own death he destroyed him
that had the power of death, and secured victory to all his
followers: he changed its aspect from that of the king of terrors
to that of a welcome messenger from their redeeming God, to conduct
them to those blessed mansions which he has purchased and prepared
for them; neither will he leave them alone with that messenger:
'And if I go, I will come again and receive you to myself, that
where I am, there ye may be also. I will not leave you comfortless,
I will come to you. The world seeth me no more, but ye see me;
because I live, ye shall live also. Let not your heart be troubled,
neither let it be afraid.' Amen. 'Come, Lord Jesus.'</p>
<!--Page 282--><a name="P282" id="P282"></a>
<p>"'Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast
thou opened: burnt-offering and sin-offering hast thou not
required. Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is
written of me, I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is
in my heart.' Psalm 40:6. 'Above when he said, Sacrifice and
offering and burnt-offerings and offering for sin thou wouldst not,
neither hadst pleasure therein &mdash; which are offered by the law
&mdash; then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh
away the first, that he may establish the second. By the which will
we are sanctified, through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ
once for all. This man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins
for ever, sat down on the right hand of God. For by one offering he
hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified. Whereof the Holy
Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,
'This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days,'
in consequence of Christ's doing the will of God, fulfilling all
righteousness: 'I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their
minds will I write them; and their sins and iniquities will I
remember no more. Now, where remission of these is, there is no
more offering for sin. Having, therefore, boldness to enter into
the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which
he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his
flesh; and having a High-priest over the house of God; let us draw
near with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, having our
hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed
with pure water. Let us hold fast the profession of our faith
without wavering; for he is <!--Page 283--><a name="P283" id=
"P283"></a> faithful that promised.' Hebrews 10:8-23; 8:10.
Again, 'The Lord sware, and will not repent; thou art a priest for
ever after the order of Melchizedek. By so much was Jesus made a
surety of a better testament; because he continueth ever, and hath
an unchangeable priesthood. Wherefore he is able to save them to
the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to
make intercession for them,' Heb. 7:21-25. 'Christ glorified not
himself to be made a high-priest, but He that said unto him, Thou
art my Son, to-day have I begotten thee; as he saith also in
another place, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of
Melchizedek.' Heb. 5:5, 6. 'For the law maketh men high-priests
which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the
law, maketh the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.' Heb. 7:28.
'The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching
peace by Jesus Christ: He is Lord of all. How God anointed Jesus of
Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power; who went about doing
good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was
with him. To him give all the prophets witness, that through his
name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.'"
Acts 10:36-38, 43.</p>

<p>"M<font size="-1">Y DEAR, MY BELOVED</font> E<font size=

one night. I did not <!--Page 284--><a name="P284" id=

letter ready. I expect another opportunity in the course of a few
days, when I will send you a long letter, from my heart, and, I
hope, dictated by your and my Teacher.</p>
<p>"I learn by my children that you continue much in the same way
in which I left you. It is your own God who mixes your cup, and it
is to you a cup of blessing; there is no curse in it. Your Jesus
drank that cup to the very dregs, that bitter as well as sweet
might be to you a cup of blessing. O then, my darling, hold fast by
your Redeemer: he is the Lord your righteousness, and the Lord your
strength; he connects your profit with his own glory. You shall in
this protracted affliction manifest it, and hold out the word of
life to those around you.* You shall witness for him that he is the
Lord, and besides him there is no Saviour &mdash; that he gathers
the lambs in his arms, and carries them in his bosom &mdash; that
he is to them a hiding-place from the wind, and a covert from the
tempest &mdash; as rivers of water in a dry place, and as the
shadow of a great rock in a weary land. That it is he that teacheth
them to profit, and leadeth them by the way that they should go,
and that in due time he will perfect all that concerns
them.&emsp;Farewell.</p>
<p class="center">"Yours with affection,</p>
<p class="right">"I. G<font size="-1">RAHAM</font>."</p>
<p class="note">*This prediction was remarkably fulfilled in the
experience of this dear young saint; an interesting account of
whose illness and death was published in the Christian's Magazine,
and afterwards as a Tract.</p>
<br />
<!--Page 285--><a name="P285" id="P285"></a>
<p class="center">To the same.</p>
<p class="right">"R<font size="-1">OCKAWAY</font>, Sabbath,
1810.</p>
<p>"M<font size="-1">Y DEAR, MY BELOVED</font> E<font size=
"-1">LIZA</font> &mdash; I wrote you a few lines yesterday by Mr.
B&mdash;&mdash;. I now propose to fulfil my promise. I expect an opportunity
to-morrow or next day, for I saw a great many carriages pass this
way to the tavern, as I suppose, from New York. It is a common
thing with some to come here on Saturday and return on Monday, to
spend this blessed day in pastime. You would not, I know, exchange
situation's with them; you would rather be suffering than
sinning.</p>
<p>"It is your own observation that God does all in wisdom; in this
wisdom he is pleased to lengthen your day of affliction. Sin, my
darling, is the cause of all suffering; but is not always the
<i>immediate</i> cause. Besides particular chastisement for
particular sins, there are afflictions to be filled up in the body
of Christ &mdash; his church &mdash; a measure of which, in kind
and degree, is appointed by unerring wisdom to each individual
member. Col. 1:24. These sufferings bear no part in atoning for
sin, nor in redeeming our forfeited inheritance. Christ trod the
wine-press alone, and of the people there was none to help him. He
was made sin for us, who knew no sin, that we might be made the
righteousness of God in him; who when he had by himself purged our
sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high. Heb. 1:3.
Again, 'And every priest,' in the Levitical law, 'standeth daily
ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can
never take away sins: but this man, after he had offered <i>one
sacrifice</i> for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God.
For by <!--Page 286--><a name="P286" id="P286"></a> one offering
he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified. Whereof the
Holy Ghost is also a witness to us; for after he had said before'
&mdash; see from verse 5 &mdash; 'This is the covenant which I will
make with them after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws
into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them; and their
sins and iniquities will I remember no more. Now, where remission
of these is, there is no more offering for sin.' Heb. 10:11-18.
Paul says the Holy Ghost is a witness, because he copies from the
ancient Scriptures the prophecies of Jer. 31:31, and Ezek. 36:25,
and from Psalm 60:7. Your mother will read to you also the eighth
chapter of Hebrews, containing the same things, the new covenant,
in consequence of Christ, as the surety of sinners, having made
full atonement, magnified the law, and made it honorable; therefore
there is now no condemnation to them who are in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>"It has pleased God, my darling, in the adorable plan of
reconciling sinners to himself by Jesus Christ, to perfect at once
a justifying righteousness for them, and to bestow it upon them as
a free gift. 'This is the record, that God hath given to us eternal
life; and this life is in his Son.' 1 John, 5:11. But it has not
pleased him to deliver us at once from depravity; provision is made
for final deliverance by the same covenant, and is effected by the
same power: but in this believers are called to work. It is evident
from Scripture, and the experience of Christians answers to it,
that in the hour of believing they pass from death to life,
considered as a state. This is the hour of the new birth: they then
receive life for the time, and it is their privilege, by the
constitution of the new covenant, to <!--Page 287--><a name="P287"
id="P287"></a> ask and receive, from day to day, grace to help
in every time of need. To them, and not to the unregenerate, the
exhortation is addressed, 'Work out your own salvation with fear
and trembling, for it is God who worketh in you, both to will and
to do, of his good pleasure,' The means are of God's appointing, in
the diligent use of which they go from strength to strength. The
grand means is faith in God's promises, of which there are very
many in the Scriptures. Believers are to put forth their own
exertions, as the children of Israel were called to go out against
their enemies, in the faith that God would give them victory and
lead them to their promised rest. The battle was the Lord's, and he
fought for them; but the means were their exertions. Believers are
God's workmanship; but this work he carries on by exercising their
natural powers, which he sanctifies to a different end from that to
which they were formerly by their own spirit directed. Still, the
Scripture testifies that if any man say he has no sin, he deceives
himself, and the truth is not in him; and while sin remains, its
consequence, suffering, must. The judgments of God, as the moral
Governor of the world, are denounced against, and executed upon the
workers of iniquity. The children of God experience personal
chastisements for personal sins, as a provision of the covenant.
Psalm 89:30. And, if I mistake not, there are afflictions
experienced by individuals, as members of Christ's body, in which
God does not bring into view the personal sins of the sufferer. In
this sense I read Paul's epistle to the Colossians, 1:24: 'Who now
rejoice in my sufferings, and fill up that which is behind of the
sufferings of Christ in my flesh, for his body's sake, which is the
<!--Page 288--><a name="P288" id="P288"></a> church.' 'I sent
Timotheus to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your
faith, that no man should be moved by these afflictions; for
yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.' 1 Thes. 3:3.
'Yea, if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith,
I joy and rejoice with you all; for the same cause do ye joy and
rejoice with me.' Phil. 2:17. 'And whether we be afflicted, it is
for your consolation and salvation; or whether we be comforted, it
is for your salvation and consolation.' 2 Cor. 1:6. There is no
conscious personal sin expressed in these sufferings; on the
contrary, Paul says, 'For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of
our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with
fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our
conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.' 2 Cor.
1:12.</p>
<p>"Most of the prophets and apostles suffered martyrdom. They
indeed sustained public characters, but the beggar Lazarus, who, in
addition to poverty, was full of sores, was carried by the angels
from the rich man's gate to Abraham's bosom. And thousands and tens
of thousands of redeemed highly sanctified ones have suffered
lengthened martyrdom, and perished with hunger, in holes and caves
of the earth, unknown in history, except in groups &mdash; unseen
at the time, except by the eye of the omniscient Jehovah, by whom
the hairs of their head are numbered; their tears are in his
bottle; nor shall one sigh nor one groan perish without its
result.</p>
<p>"O my Eliza, what delightful wonders shall open to our view when
delivered from these prison-holds of earth.</p>
<!--Page 289--><a name="P289" id="P289"></a>
<p>"I have finished one sheet, my dear Eliza; I fear it is too
much, and may prove too fatiguing, especially as there are many
references requiring a stretch of attention. I have been reading
the epistle to the Hebrews, and you have naturally got my thoughts
on part of it.</p>
<p>"I remember once of your complaining that you had made small
progress in knowledge, in comparison of a young person that had
just left you; but you checked yourself, and said, 'The Lord has
given me faith, let me be thankful.' I at that time considered your
departure as very near, and advised you to keep your eye fixed on
Christ, as your Redeemer and Saviour, who had performed all things
for you, and would perfect all that concerned you; and added, one
hour in heaven will make you wiser than the most enlightened saint
on earth. Since that it has pleased your Lord to add many days to
your life. He has mitigated your pain, and given you some intervals
of ease and composure, and our dear Eliza has grown in that time.
Should it please God to spare you for a yet longer season, and
continue your intervals of ease, no subject can be so profitable;
and I hope your Lord will make it pleasant as that of the contents
of the New Testament, which your Saviour bequeathed to you, sealed
and ratified in his blood. There is a vast variety of precious
promises contained in the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament,
which are all yours with Christ; for, as a member of his body, 'you
are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus
Christ himself being the chief corner-stone.' And now I commend you
to your own covenant God, who does and will support you, through
life and through <!--Page 290--><a name="P290" id="P290"></a>
death, to that happy land where we shall all meet; and Oh then, eye
hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart
of man the things he hath prepared for them that love him.</p>

<p class="right">"R<font size="-1">OCKAWAY</font>, Long Island.</p>
<p>"M<font size="-1">Y DEAR</font> J<font size="-1">AMES</font>
&mdash; This will probably be handed you by our mutual friend Mrs.
C&mdash;&mdash;. The thought of her being with you, makes me part with her
with less reluctance. You have not been forgotten by either; we
have talked much of you, and have united in prayer to your and our
God, that he may manifest himself unto you as your reconciled
Father in Christ Jesus; and give you 'joy and peace in believing'
&mdash; that he may give you patience in suffering, and entire
resignation to his most holy will.</p>
<p>"It has, my dear young friend, been my earnest inquiry,
especially of late years, standing on the brink of eternity, 'What
is there within us, or without us, on which a sinner can rest in a
dying hour?' If it be a holy life, there is no peace for me. Taking
the law of God for my rule, backslider is my name; yet peace I have
found, and on the best Security; this blessed Bible is my charter.
I have searched it with diligence and prayer, and my mind is
confirmed in the following truths: That the whole world is become
guilty before God, and is under his wrath and curse on that
account. This is our state: a miserable state it is, and as
hopeless as miserable, for any thing we can do merely of ourselves.
But I read in this Bible to the full amount of the following
conclusions &mdash; that in the counsel of <!--Page 291--><a name=
"P291" id="P291"></a> the mysterious Triune Jehovah, Jesus
Christ, the second person of the incomprehensible Trinity, was
sanctified, or set apart to become the Saviour of law-condemned
sinners, to take their nature upon him, comply with the
requisitions of the eternal immutable law of God, and become their
surety. Man is a rebel, it is put to his account: a penalty is
incurred &mdash; He, as their surety, is made liable. Are they
again to be made heirs of eternal life? Perfect obedience is the
condition &mdash; and of Him, as their surety, it is demanded. All
this being fulfilled, sinners are become his property: he has paid
their debt, and merited for them eternal life, all in their own
nature, as their Head and representative; so that believers are
complete in him. This is the righteousness of God, wrought out by
Jesus Christ, in his own person, God-man, as their surety. To this
nothing of the believer's is to be added &mdash; with this nothing
of his mixed; it is for ever perfect; entirely distinct from that
holiness of heart and life which is wrought in him in consequence
of this. God has declared himself well pleased with this
righteousness, and that being himself reconciled, he is in Christ
Jesus reconciling sinners to him.</p>
<p>"Hence all the invitations scattered thick in the Old and New
Testament, not only to the penitent, weary, and heavy laden, but to
the stout-hearted, the backslider, to them that are wearying
themselves in their own way. 'Ho, every one that thirsteth' &mdash;
'Whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely,' Hence all
the promises annexed to believing, accepting, receiving, trusting,
resting: Christ the Saviour is the object &mdash; the gift of God
to sinners for all the above purposes. The Lord has convinced me
that I have <!--Page 292--><a name="P292" id="P292"></a> nothing
in myself on which I can rest; my conscience echoes to his word in
all that it asserts of my nature and my state; but this Saviour is
provided for sinners exactly of this description. I am invited to
put in my claim, I believe the record, I rest my salvation on his
word; God giveth to me eternal life, and this life is in his Son.
Jesus calls me to look unto him, and be saved; I do look unto him,
and I am saved. He assures me that those who come unto him shall
never be cast out. I do go to him and commit my sinful soul to his
keeping; I shall not be cast out. As many as receive the gift of
his Son, receive at the same time power to become the children of
God. I do receive his gift, and lay claim to his promise. He is my
reconciled Father, and I am his adopted child, and he hath sent his
Spirit into my heart, by which I can say, Abba, Father.</p>
<p>"I have, my dear James, taken this method of laying before you
the grounds of my own hope, because I think it the most simple
method, and containing at the same time my counsel to you to lay
hold on the same hope. The warrant is given us in God's own word,
as sinners, without respect to fruit or any works of ours. I can,
if necessary, give you chapter and verse, to the full amount; but
you have those about you who can give it to you by little and
little, as your weak state can bear it. This gift is held out to
the sinner's acceptance in many places of the word of God, and
becomes the sinner's in the moment of believing. Provision is made
by the same covenant for his sanctification; but that makes no part
of justifying righteousness. Christ is made of God unto him wisdom,
righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. Try, my
<!--Page 293--><a name="P293" id="P293"></a> precious young
friend, to lay hold on this hope, and enter into the rest provided
for the believer here. Stretch forth 'the withered hand,' the Lord
himself will give you strength. Commit your precious soul into his
hands, and rest assured that he will perfect all that concerns you
&mdash; work all his work in you &mdash; carry you safely through
the Jordan of death, and put you in possession of the inheritance
he has purchased for you. That all this shall be, is the prayer
and firm hope of</p>

<p>The two following extracts, addressed to Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash;, near
Boston, present a very gratifying view of Mrs. Graham in her
advanced years, and may well awaken the desire not only to die the
death, but to enjoy the "fruitful old age" of "the righteous."</p>
<p>"I have, as you know, enjoyed much in life, enjoyed its dearest,
sweetest comforts, love and friendship, with a heart tremblingly
alive to both. Lover and friends of youth are long since gone,
other friendships I have formed, and have been happy even in these;
now I am shut up with ails and aches. The world, properly so
called, is a dead blank to me; yet I do think I never enjoyed life
more. I would not exchange my present happiness for the most
transporting moments of my life &mdash; of which I have had a large
share &mdash; though thousands of years were added to enjoy them. I
do not mean barely that happiness which consists in the
anticipation of pleasure beyond the grave; that is indeed
delightful; but I enjoy life now. Books of taste are mine no more:
still less those of science and <!--Page 294--><a name="P294" id=

dear Saviour. The height, the depth, the breadth, the length of the
glorious plan of redemption open to my delightful perception more
and more, and the Spirit witnesseth with my spirit, that I have my
part in it by the gift of <i>faith</i>. I believe the record, that
God giveth to us eternal life, and I put in my claim as a sinner. I
account it a 'faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that
Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the
chief,' I still enjoy the ordinances of the gospel: my memory, as
you know, is much impaired: I recollect very little of the sermons
I hear; but I think I never heard with so much attention. I am
delighted, instructed, and fed at the time, and the subjects open
to me without my being able to recollect the order or the words of
the speaker. O let me recommend this dear Lord to your heart and
confidence; commit all your concerns to him; mistrust no part of
his providential dealings with you; his wisdom shall manage for
you, and you shall one day say, 'He hath done all things
well.'"</p>

<p>"I am daily on the lookout; one year and three months will
complete my threescore and ten. I do not know one individual alive
whom I know in my school-days; it has been the case for many years.
I do not long for my dismission, neither am I tired of life; but
nothing in this world, unless closely connected with another,
interests me; and Oh, I am tired of sin; still it cleaves to me; in
all things I come short, and many duties neglect altogether; for I
still have a considerable, share of health, and might do some good,
had I will equal to my opportunities; as to the
<!--Page 295--><a name="P295" id="P295"></a> power, it is not in
me, but I know I have it in my blessed Head, and for the asking. I
cannot but long to be delivered from sin, and sinful apathy in
particular; for really my heart must be wickedly fertile, to find
out opportunities of moral transgression. Food and raiment are mine
without care; my children, under God, care for me. I have my dear
little room, my Bible, and books founded on it. I have a dear
pastor and Christian friends, lively ordinances, and also much of
the Lord's presence at times; my cup runs over with blessings, but
my gratitude bears no proportion; my zeal for the glory of God and
the good of my fellow-sinners seems buried under self-indulgence
and apathy. O that the goodness of the Lord may lead me to
repentance.</p>
<p>"And now, my dear friend, let me know how it is with you and
your dear family. The severe winter is past; how have you got
along? with what temporal comfort, and how has the Lord dealt with
your soul? Has the barrel of meal or the cruse of oil failed? Does
the opening spring cheer your spirits, and furnish a song of
praise? Does it find you in a situation to dig your garden, sow
your seeds, and make provision for future comfort? Has the Lord
turned your captivity, and dried up the bitter waters that flowed
against you? How are your eyes, after all the briny tears that have
steeped them? How are your poor nerves, after all the shocks that
have agitated them? All these things have been on my mind; but from
my long silence, you cannot believe it. What are we all, but broken
reeds, which pierce the hand when laid hold of for support? There
is but one Friend to poor, fallen, miserable man, in the universe.
He is mercy; <!--Page 296--><a name="P296" id="P296"></a> he is
goodness; he is truth; he is wisdom; he is unchangeable, and never
will fail you: take him to your heart; give it all to him; he only
is worthy, no other is."</p>
<p>Her friend Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash; had now experienced new trials, by which

<p>"I received my dear friend's letter this day week, and have been
answering it ever since. Never was I in such a strait. It contains
the effusions of disappointed hopes and anticipations of sore
evils; indicates a soul deeply wounded, and taking in Christian
principles under temptation. Where shall I begin? I have laid it
before our compassionate High-priest, I have requested direction.
Assist me, O thou blessed Comforter, whose office it is to convince
of sin, as well as to minister consolation. Do both, from the heart
and by the pen of thy handmaid.</p>
<p>"It appears to me salutary to call your attention first to the
sovereignty of God. The silver and the gold are his, and the cattle
on a thousand hills; he gives them to whomsoever he pleases; he
setteth up one and putteth down another, doing whatsoever pleaseth
him in the armies of heaven, and among the inhabitants of this
earth; none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou? He
attributes to himself all events; men and other creatures are but
instruments. Men's wicked hearts impel them to commit evil, but the
events are of the Lord, which he <!--Page 297--><a name="P297" id=
"P297"></a> overrules for his own glory, and for the good of his
people. 'Him being delivered by the determinate counsel' of God, ye
have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified him. Joseph said,
'Ye thought evil against me; but God meant it for good,' 'to save
much people alive.' The Lord does not often, at the time, give his
people reasons for afflicting them, though they can often read them
at an after-period.</p>
<p>"Job was a holy man; his afflictions from God's own hand were
very deep; the teasing unkindness and injustice of his friends made
great part of the temptation, and he spoke unadvisedly with his
lips. When God did appear, he did not answer his cavils, nor give
him one reason why he had dealt with him thus; but silenced him
with views of his majesty, power, and wisdom &mdash; of his own
meanness and vileness, though correct in his conduct beyond most
others. I believe he spoke truth when he said, 'I delivered the
poor that cried, and the fatherless, and him that had none to help
him. The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me, and
I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy. I was eyes to the
blind, and feet was I to the lame. I was a father to the poor, and
the cause which I knew not, I searched out.' God allowed the weight
of the trial to be upon his spirit, with the conviction of his
presumption, till he brought him to his feet. 'Behold, I am vile,
what shall I answer thee?' 'I will lay my hand upon my mouth.' 'I
abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.' These things were
written for our example and profit.</p>
<p>"This afflictive providence is now finished, at least so far.
What you now possess is the allotment of your God. Set all
instruments aside and listen to the <!--Page 298--><a name="P298"
id="P298"></a> Holy Ghost: 'Humble yourselves under the mighty
hand of God, and he shall exalt you in due time.' In order to this,
I would recommend to you to take a close, retrospective view of
your past life, with earnest prayer that God would search you and
try you, and show you what wicked ways have been or now are in you.
Go back to the days of your youth; take a close view of the use you
made of affluence and influence; not comparing yourself with
others, but judging yourself by the law of God, the only standard
of right and wrong, truth and error. Seek for humbling views of
yourself in yourself. If the Holy Ghost enlighten, you will find
sufficient grounds. Seek for consolation in the free promises of
God, through Jesus Christ, of which there are also abundance, even
to the chief of sinners. What I recommend to you has been my own
practice, especially in times of trial; and if health will admit of
it, add fasting, because I think it is the Lord's ordinance. 'The
days shall come when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, then
shall they fast in those days.'</p>
<p>"Read the third chapter of Jeremiah's lamentations; endeavor to
come under the feelings of contrition on account of your sins, and
derive consolation from faith in God's great mercy; ever keeping in
view the only channel through which mercy can flow to sinners of
Adam's race. Take also a view of God's dealings with his elect
nation, in the wilderness: they had nothing but manna, and were
punished for murmuring; while at that very time the nations in
Canaan, the Egyptians, and Assyrians, were living in all manner of
luxury. What was their whole history but backsliding, threatening
upon threatening? then chastisement, <!--Page 299--><a name="P299"
id="P299"></a> turning, repenting, pardon, reconciliation, and
the same round again, every chastisement severer than the last,
while worldlings in general have their day to the end; then 'are
they brought into desolation as in a moment.' I wish you to take a
particular view of God's dealings with them, before Nebuchadnezzar
sacked the city of Jerusalem. The decree was passed after many
warnings, and much long-suffering. How many pauses, as it were, did
the merciful Lord God make before he gave them finally up to their
enemies; and when the decree was irrevocable, and the chastisement
to take place, still he followed them with mercy. See Jeremiah
27:12; and chapter 29, the letter which God commanded Jeremiah to
write to those who had been carried away captive with Jehoiakim,
advising them to build houses and plant vineyards, and to make the
most of their situation. Those at Jerusalem were commanded to
submit to the king of Babylon, as in that case he would not destroy
the city; but no, they stood it out, and the threatened vengeance
overtook them.</p>
<p>"The poor were left to take care of the vineyards. Jeremiah
remained with them in preference to going with the king of Babylon
to be promoted to honor. God offered to take them under his
protection and be their God: but no, they would go to Egypt, and
put themselves under the king of Egypt's protection. Jeremiah told
them from the Lord, that Egypt itself should soon go into
captivity. But to Egypt they went and carried Jeremiah with them.
See Isaiah's prophecy on this occasion, chapter 30:1-4. Now look at
chapter 42:24; there you see God's judgment and chastening; follow
him in the beginning of chapter 43, <!--Page 300--><a name="P300"
id="P300"></a> and view his mercy; in the end of the same
chapter, again, see his charge against them, but it is followed,
with mercy, not judgment.</p>
<p>"Thus we learn the character of God. Thus we learn his dealings
with his people. They are not called to earthly comfort and
prosperity. They ever have been, and still are a suffering people;
they are all sinners &mdash; sin brings suffering, and God
overrules suffering, so as to make it profitable to them. Though
redeemed by the life and death of Christ, being justified by faith,
they have peace with God; yet the Lord has not pleased all at once
to qualify them for the purchased possession. They receive a new
birth, new life, and are called to work out their own salvation
with fear and trembling, with this consolation, that God worketh in
them both to will and to do of his good pleasure. This is not their
home, here they have no continuing city; they are travelling
through the wilderness, to the city and mansions purchased and
prepared for them by their Saviour, and must be made holy before
they can enter in. They have many corruptions to be mortified, and
many errors in their estimation of men and things to be corrected.
Their hearts require to be made spiritual, humble, tender,
resigned, and loving. 'Who fed thee in the wilderness with manna
&mdash; that he might humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to
do thee good at thy latter end.'</p>
<p>"Besides, all suffering is not the immediate punishment of sin
in the individual sufferer, nor for his exclusive profit; it is
evident from Scripture, there is suffering for the benefit of the
body of Christ, <i>his church</i>, of which, I think, all have some
share. God <!--Page 301--><a name="P301" id="P301"></a> has wise
ends to answer by all the suffering of his creatures, and
especially of the members of his body. The apostles rejoiced in
this, and so ought we. 'If we suffer with him, we shall also reign
with him.' Paul says, 'I fill up in my flesh that which is behind
of the sufferings of Christ, for his body's sake, which is the
church.'</p>
<p>"Now, my dear friend, look at your real situation, as a
suffering member of a suffering body. Take a view of the saints of
God in history, sacred or profane, and compare your own individual
suffering with theirs: I am apt to think that, great as it is, it
will not rise to mediocrity. I could expatiate on this subject,
from what comes every day within my own knowledge. The Lord is
working in this way all around me; but of that another time. In
your own case, try for a moment to shut out of view every thing
without your own family, what you once were, what you once
possessed and enjoyed; also what your friends possess and enjoy at
this present time; detach yourself from all. What was yours is
gone; what you calculated upon is also gone; set all aside, and
consider yourself a sinner saved from destruction by grace; in a
state of purgation and preparation for happiness; on a pilgrimage
with thousands of others your fellow-saved sinners, through the
wilderness, to that inheritance which was purchased for you at
<i>such a price</i>. Your Saviour is your leader, protector,
provider; also your physician, and the physician of the whole body,
perfectly acquainted with the constitution, disposition, and temper
of every individual. He has made provision for each, all the
journey through, and given security that none shall suffer
<i>real</i> want.</p>
<!--Page 302--><a name="P302" id="P302"></a>
<p>"Bread and water are promised; nothing beyond these, though in
general he gives more; to each he gives a portion in hand, to some
for a day, some for a week, some for a year, which they calculate
upon with more or less probability: none with certainty. Your
portion is &mdash; for a year; take a view of those whom you know;
one with another, I am inclined to think the Lord has still given
you your full share of privilege. Look at the ordinary provision he
makes for the ministers of his gospel, most of them with large
families; many of those in the country have five hundred dollars,
some four hundred, some three hundred, generally ill paid. The Lord
puts a blessing in it, he makes it go far; they do what their hands
find to do, and get along: so will he do with you, my dear. He will
put you upon methods of industry and economy: your one chicken
divided into six parts, with a little bit of pork, with the fruit
of God's blessing on your industry in the garden, shall both taste
sweet and satisfy for the time. Try to be thankful; Moses said of
the manna, 'This is the bread which the Lord your God giveth you.'
Pray and watch against dwelling on the plentiful tables of others;
and when bidden to a feast take your portion, and say, this is from
the Lord for the time. Do not let a thought of misery or
wretchedness dwell upon your mind. O no, God is good; you shall not
want. O, what sweet meals have I and my children made on hot
potatoes, nicely boiled and cracked, with salt &mdash; not merely
content, but they tasted good and savory. There are peculiar
pleasures in a life of that kind. You shall yet sing of it.</p>
<p>"Now, my dear friend, I have done with what I
<!--Page 303--><a name="P303" id="P303"></a> had to say on this
head. I have had great fears of wounding, lest you should reckon me
among Job's friends; but you call me mother, and it is required of
a mother to be faithful. I now leave it with the Lord. We are
delighted to find you girding up the loins of your mind and setting
about active duty. Let us meet at a throne of grace, and look to
the course the Lord marks out for us."</p>
<br />
<p class="center">To Mrs. G&mdash;&mdash; Y&mdash;&mdash;.</p>
<p>"M<font size="-1">Y DEAR</font> M<font size="-1">ADAM</font>
&mdash; I have just parted with my dear afflicted friend Mrs.
C&mdash;&mdash;; she left it in charge to me, that I should write to you in
the time of your affliction. Surely I would do any thing whatever
that I thought might alleviate either her or your distress. But
there are cases to which God alone can speak; afflictions which he
alone can console. Such are those under which the sufferer is
commanded to be 'still and know that he is God.' He never leaves
his people in any case, but sometimes shuts them up from human aid.
Their grief is too great to be consoled by human tongue or pen.</p>
<p>"Such I have experienced. I lost my only son; I neither know
when nor where; and for any thing I know, in a state of rebellion
against God. Here at my heart it lies still; who can speak to me of
it? neither can I reason upon it. Aaron held his peace. Old Eli
said, 'It is the Lord; let him do what seemeth him good.' Samuel in
his turn had his heart wrung by his ungodly son. David lamented
over his beloved Absalom; but it availed him nothing. Job's sons
and daughters were all cut off in one day; he himself lay in deep,
sore bodily affliction; his friends sat seven days and seven nights
without opening their <!--Page 304--><a name="P304" id=
"P304"></a> mouths, because they saw his affliction was very
great; and if they spoke, it was to aggregate it; and when God
himself spoke, he gave him no reason for his dealings, but charged
him with folly and madness. 'Shall he that contendeth with the
Almighty instruct him? He that reproveth God, let him answer it.'
Then he laid his hand on his mouth, confessed himself vile, and
became dumb before God; abhorring himself, and repenting in dust
and ashes, instead of the splendid catalogue of virtues enumerated
in chapter 29, and complaints in chapter 10, which I make not the
least doubt were true, as far as human virtue can reach; but if God
charge even his angels with folly, shall man, corrupt,
self-destroyed man, plead merit before God?</p>
<p>"But, my dear friend, I do not find in all God's Bible any thing
requiring us to acquiesce in the final destruction of any, for whom
we have prayed, pleaded, and committed to him; least of all, our
offspring whom he has commanded us to train up for him. Children
are God's heritage. I do not say he has given us any promise for
the obstinately wicked; but when cut off, he only requires us to be
still, to hold our peace. I do not think he takes hope from us. God
has set limits to our faith for others; our faith must not rest in
opposition to his threatenings. We must believe that the wicked
shall be turned into hell, and all that forget God; but he hath set
no bounds to his own mercy; in that glorious plan of redemption, by
which he substitutes his own Son in the stead of sinners, he has
made provision for the chief of sinners, and can now be just and
consistent while he justifies the ungodly who believe in Jesus.
Short was the <!--Page 305--><a name="P305" id="P305"></a> time
between the thief's petition and the promise of salvation; nay, the
petition was the earnest of it. The same was the case with the
jailer; I think, too, the publican had the earnest in his petition.
Now, instead of laboring to bring my mind to acquiesce in the
condemnation of my child, on the supposition of its being for God's
glory, I try to be still, as he has commanded: not to follow my
child to the yet invisible world; but turning my eyes to that
character which God has revealed of himself &mdash; to the plan of
redemption &mdash; to the sovereignty of God in the execution of
that plan &mdash; to his names of grace, 'The Lord, the Lord God,
merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and
truth, forgiving iniquity, and transgression, and sin,' while he
adds, 'and that will by no means clear the guilty;' I meet it with
his own declaration, 'He hath made Him to be sin for us who knew no
sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.' I read
also that 'mercy rejoiceth against judgment,' and many other like
scriptures, which, although I dare not ground a belief of his
salvation on them, afford one ray of hope after another, that God
may have made him a monument of mercy to the glory of his
grace.</p>
<p>"Thus God himself consoles his own praying people, while man
ought to be very cautious, if not silent, where the Scriptures are
silent, as it respects the final state of another, whose heart we
cannot know, nor what God may have wrought in it. God hath set
bounds to our faith, which can nowhere find solid ground to fix
upon but in his own written promise. Yet, as I said above, he has
set no bounds to his own mercy, and he has made provision for its
boundless <!--Page 306--><a name="P306" id="P306"></a> flow, as
far as he shall please to extend it, through the atonement and
merits of his own Son, 'who is able to save to the uttermost all
who come unto God by him,' Now, my dear friend, you have my ideas
of our situation; if they be correct, I pray that our compassionate
Father may comfort you by them; if otherwise, may he pardon what is
amiss, and lead you, my dear friend C&mdash;&mdash;, and myself, to such
consolation as he himself will own as the work of his Spirit, and
save us from the enemy and our own spirit.</p>
<p>"Since writing the foregoing, I feel afraid of what I have said;
it is dangerous seeking comfort where the Scriptures are silent;
yet while we plead with God to be preserved from error, and try to
be still before him, he will save us from the subtlety of the
serpent, as well as from the rage of the lion. I am, with love,</p>

hear the word of God read, and to be led to meditate upon it,
however simple and common the exposition, also refreshes me. I am
generally led to pray much for minister and people; to consider
myself as one with them in Christ. However weak his natural powers,
however few or small his talents, if I have reason to think that he
is taught of God that which flesh and blood cannot teach, I desire
to esteem him highly for his work's sake. I thank God for the
meanest and weakest of such: I believe they never labor in vain.
'Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings,' in talents as well as
in years, God will perfect praise.</p>
<p>"In this new world, thickly settled in many places with natural
men 'eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage,' while
the flood of wrath is hastening to overwhelm them, and none to warn
them of their danger, nor point out the ark of safety; shall such
men be reckoned of none account, and their labors of no value? No,
the wealth of both Indies cannot balance their work; nor all the
talents ever possessed by fallen man, with all the orthodoxy which
mere talents are capable of acquiring, without that divine teaching
which many of those, thus contemned, possess. That same small
discourse, those few plain points, these same things repeated in
the same way, contain truths by which sinners may be saved, by
which sinners shall be saved.</p>

Exert your energies, ye gifted doctors of divinity; and may the
Lord prosper the means used to produce a ministry which shall
render attendance upon their ministrations the interest of both the
understanding and the heart. Persuade men who are adding field to
field, house to house, thousand to thousand, to provide a competent
maintenance for them. If these last remain obstinate, and it be
idle to hope that youths of talents without fortune, whatever be
their piety, will serve the church of God at the expense of
devoting themselves to infallible penury, and all the wretchedness
which belongs to it &mdash; is it wise to weaken the hands and
discourage the hearts of those ministers already settled pastors,
or to furnish their people with arguments in their own vindication
for leaving them in want and penury?"</p>
<p>In the year 1811, some gentlemen of New York established a
Magdalen Society: they elected a board of ladies, requesting their
aid to superintend the internal management of the Magdalen House.
This board chose Mrs. Graham their presiding lady, which office she
held until her decease; the duties attendant on it she discharged
with fidelity and zeal. In 1812 the trustees of the Lancasterian
school solicited the attendance of several pious ladies, to give
catechetical instruction to their scholars one afternoon in every
week: and Mrs. Graham was one of those who attended regularly to
this duty.</p>

<p>"'B<font size="-1">Y</font> faith Moses, when he was come to
years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter;
esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures
of Egypt; for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward:
choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than
to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season.' Heb. 11:24.</p>
<p>"All that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer
persecution; the natural heart is enmity against God, and hates his
image wherever found. If individual Christians have the favor of
individual worldlings, it never is for their piety, that is rather
borne with than loved; and too often Christians save themselves
from reproach by unfaithfulness; that, alas, has been my sin and
shame. In all my friendships with worldlings, some of which have
been tender, how unfaithful have I been to friendship's highest
office. How seldom have I endeavored to rescue my friend from sin
and Satan, by leading her to the Friend of sinners, the source of
happiness. Contenting my vile, selfish heart, with things
pertaining to this life unconnected with that to come, leaving her
under the influence of 'the lust of the eye, the lust of the flesh,
and the pride of life;' without eyes to see her danger, or friend
to warn her of it; and while she communicated with me in things
common to both, in all the good she <!--Page 310--><a name="P310"
id="P310"></a> knew, keeping back nothing from me of all she
possessed; how often have I concealed my richest treasure, without
inviting her to the participation. O, faithless friend! O,
ungrateful, unfaithful &mdash; first to that gracious God who
opened mine own eyes, arrested ray attention, stopped up my path,
and turned me to the way of life; and next to my friend, whom I
have left to pursue that same way of death, without attempting to
lead her to this same sovereign, merciful, gracious Deliverer.</p>
<p>"And what withheld! Shame belongs to the heart governed by such
motives; fear of contempt, reproach, or, at most, the loss of a
carnal friendship. Of three such friends, now gone to their place,
two continued their worldly course to the last, so far as I know;
for the third the Lord provided a more faithful friend, who became
worker together with the Spirit of God, led her to the Friend of
sinners, who has compassion on the ignorant, and them that are out
of the way, By Him she was received, and in Him she found life,
light, and peace.</p>
<p>"She soon outran faithless me in the heavenly race; gently chid
me for my remissness, but continued my friend and helper. Ever
foremost in the race, humble and steady in faith, she looked not
back, nor halted. She has long since finished her course, received
her crown and reward of grace, and become fruit to the account of
that friend who supplied what was wanting in me. I rejoice with
them both, give glory to God, from whom their fruit was found, and
take shame and confusion for my part.</p>
<p>"How many opportunities have I lost, and from the same sinful,
shameful cause. O my Redeemer, <!--Page 311--><a name="P311" id=

of the world,' John 1:29.</p>
<p>"He dwelt chiefly on the substitution of the victim in the room
of the transgressor. When a victim was offered for an individual,
he was to lay his hand on the head of the animal, by the
appointment of God, as a token of his faith that his sins should be
transferred to the victim which suffered death in his stead, and
that his sins were forgiven and his person <!--Page 312--><a name=
"P312" id="P312"></a> accepted. If the victim was for the whole
congregation, then the elders, as their representatives, were to
lay their hands upon the head of the victim, signifying the same
faith. Great was the subject of the plan of redemption: The Son of
God clothed with our nature, given and set apart as a propitiatory
sacrifice, the victim upon whom the sins of his elect were laid,
and he sacrificed in their stead.</p>

Jewish transgressors, but the sins of the elect out of every

Lamb of God rests my own individual hope for pardon and for
acceptance. I lay my own individual hand of faith on his dear head,
confess my sin, and rely upon his sacrifice for pardon and
acceptance, through the atonement made by himself, God's anointed
Priest."</p>

shall suffer persecution.' 2&nbsp;Timothy 3:12. Gone as usual; but
it came home to my heart. I have not suffered persecution; and why?
because my life has not testified sufficiently against a sinful
world. Alas, alas! the world loves its own, and I have been so
accommodating, to say the least, as not to disturb it. 'The carnal
mind is enmity against God; is not subject to the law of God,
neither indeed can be;' but the world saw little in me of that
image which they hate, and enough of assimilation to balance that
little. O my God, my long-suffering, sin-pardoning God, thou
knowest my vile cowardice; with professors a professor of thy name,
with worldlings a seeming worldling. And now the season is
<!--Page 313--><a name="P313" id="P313"></a> past, the
opportunity lost; the time of life is arrived when the world itself
expects to be abandoned. No line of conduct in me will now reprove
them; they account it wise to look out for a better portion, when
the world can no longer be enjoyed; and through the deceitfulness
of their own hearts, and the suggestions of the ever-vigilant enemy
of souls, may be hardened in sin, by hoping to become religious in
old age. O, let thy grace prevent it.</p>
<p>"The sinfulness, and O, the ingratitude of my past life rise in
magnitude every review I take of it. And what can I say? Father,
forgive. Yes, I dare say, Father, forgive. I dare say more, Thou
hast forgiven. This grief of heart proves that thou hast not sealed
me up in impenitence. Thou rememberest thy covenant with me in the
days of my youth, when thou didst draw me with the cords of love
and the bands of a man; and though no language can express my
baseness and my ingratitude, through all my backsliding life, thy
covenant stands fast.</p>

<p>"Was much melted under a sense of indwelling sin, and the
deceitfulness of the human heart, and of my own heart in

contrition for the sins of my past life, and exercised in watching
over my words, thoughts, and actions; now that the Lord has
delivered me from all necessity to care, having every thing
provided for me <i>necessary to life and godliness:</i> pleasant
food and clothing both for body and mind; my dear room, retirement,
fire, candle, attendance; my precious Bible, and precious, lively,

merciful and gracious has awarded, under the constant influence of
shame and confusion for my highly aggravated transgressions: but I
also enjoy the full sense of pardon; being justified by faith, I
have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ; and knowing that
I have a 'great high-priest that is <!--Page 315--><a name="P315"

I am enabled to hold fast my profession, comforted by this, that I
have not a high-priest who cannot be touched with the feeling of my
infirmities, but was in all points tempted as we are, yet without
sin. I dare come, not very boldly, for I am under much depression,
to the throne of grace, that I may obtain mercy and find grace to
help in time of need. Every time is a time of need with me, for sin
still dwelleth in me. I have peace with God through my dear Lord
and Saviour Jesus Christ, but am at constant war with myself. I
plead thy promise, that thou wilt subdue my iniquities, that sin
shall not have dominion over me. And now, Captain of salvation, I
renew the fight, but it is depending upon thee to fight for me,
with me, and in me. I will set myself to watch, but I shall watch

motives for returning home for a time, I embraced this season in
particular; having, in the compass of one week, Sabbath, Wednesday
my birthday, and the day set apart both by the General Assembly of
our church and the Governor of our state, for fasting, prayer, and
humiliation, besides lectures on the same evening. I returned
therefore on Friday, the 24th.</p>
<p>"Dr. R&mdash;&mdash; preached from Psalm 27:1,'The Lord is my light and my
salvation; whom shall I fear? the Lord is the strength of my life;
of whom shall I be afraid?'</p>
<!--Page 316--><a name="P316" id="P316"></a>
<p>"O my God, my merciful and gracious God, what can I say of thy
amazing, distinguishing mercy to me? Delivered from all these
fears, and able to adopt the text fully, I know of none who have
more or greater cause of fear as sinners. My transgressions have
been of <i>crimson</i> and <i>scarlet</i> hue. O my God, thou
knowest them, words cannot paint them. My Saviour, thou knowest
them, for thou baredst them; every jot and tittle was put to thy
account, and thou didst cancel all. O that garden, that cry on the
cross! the effects were seen on thy sacred body, but who can
conceive the mysterious horror which agonized thy sacred soul? But
thou saidst, <i>It is finished,</i> and finished it is. Lamb of
God, which takest away the sins of the world, on thy consecrated
head I lay the hand of faith, confess my sins, pray for
forgiveness, and believe that I am forgiven.</p>
<p>"July 29th, my birthday, and the last day of the threescore
years and ten of my sinful life. What an, exhibition will that day
produce, when the secrets of all hearts will be laid open, all my
actions and all the springs of them. In all the myriads which shall
appear at the bar of God, will there be such a sinner &mdash;
taking into view the early grace manifested?</p>
<p>"Born, I think, about the seventeenth year of my natural life;
previously instructed in the doctrines and precepts of the
Scriptures, as far as the natural mind can conceive, by pious
parents and a faithful pastor; with milk provided for my spiritual
infancy, and richer food set before me for my growth; the leaves of
the new covenant were opened to my view, and the fulness treasured
in Christ for my supply, to be asked, to be delighted in; and
delighted I was, and <!--Page 317--><a name="P317" id=
"P317"></a> satisfied. But Oh, I forsook the fountain of living
waters, and hewed out broken cisterns, that could hold no water.
Where can language be found to depict my ingratitude, my madness,
my folly; and where to describe the long-suffering, the
compassionate remonstrances, the kindly, fatherly chastisements,
the repeated pardons and restorations of my gracious God in days of
youth &mdash; aggravating my renewed backslidings, bringing upon my
sinful soul vengeance for my inventions? What were the sins of
Israel and Judah to mine? Mine were committed after the great
atonement was made; the adorable High-priest, Jesus, had with his
own blood entered within the veil, and was set on the right hand of
the throne of the Majesty of the heavens: the minister of the
sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and
not man. The new covenant was exhibited, established on better
promises, himself the Mediator. The new and living way was
consecrated to the holiest of all by the blood of Jesus; a throne
of grace was established, Jesus himself our Advocate and
Intercessor. We are now privileged to come boldly to a throne of
grace, that we may find grace to help in the time of need. O how
aggravated my sin above theirs, having such great and precious
privileges and promises, and a High-priest who can be touched with
the feeling of our infirmities, who was in all points tempted as we
are; who owns us as his brethren and sisters, yea, the very
<i>members of his body</i>, and his Spirit dwelleth in us.</p>
<p>"I set apart the day for fasting and deep humiliation; took
another survey of my past sinful life; confessed particulars on my
knees, and made a fresh application to the blood of sprinkling
which cleanseth <!--Page 318--><a name="P318" id="P318"></a>
from all sin; took a fresh hold of his new covenant of promise.
'This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days,
saith the Lord; I will put my laws in their hearts, and in their
minds will I write them, and their sins and their iniquities will I
remember no more.' Lord, do as thou hast said. I rest my immortal

order of his discourses, I am instructed in the knowledge of the
subject and the Scriptures in general. Shall I deny the grace of
God through fear or pride? <!--Page 320--><a name="P320" id=

thing to myself? No; shame and confusion of face belong to me, for
my carelessness and idleness in the use of means during health and

but according to his own mercy, and in a way of great sovereignty.
Let me record his great goodness, his tender mercies, and bless his
name.</p>
<p>"Old age is upon me, and some of its infirmities; my memory is
much impaired, and my mind in temporal things and subjects becomes
very desultory. Not so in spirituals: I think I not only hear and
read with more intense attention and prompt application, but my
mind is more disposed to meditation; and though I cannot remember
much of the sermons I hear, yet my mind is often furnished with
happy and profitable thoughts on the same subjects; and I find
myself instructed without remembering the instructions. This is
evidently from the Lord. It appears to me also that I have not lost
the sensibility of youth. I often shed tears, not only of
compunction, but of gratitude. I seldom commune without tears. I
think much of death; am solemnized, but not afraid.</p>
<p>"As far as I know, my confidence rests upon a
surety-righteousness, exclusive of every thing in myself. I am not
conscious of self-righteousness; I have no complacency in any thing
ever done by me. I not only believe that in all things I come
short, and that sin is mixed in all I do, because God hath said so,
but am sensible of the particular depravity. It is my sincere
desire to be stript of every thing that is mine &mdash; sins and
duties laid in one heap &mdash; and to be clothed in the
surety-righteousness of my Redeemer; all that is
<!--Page 321--><a name="P321" id="P321"></a> mine put to his
account, and all that he did and suffered, as the Mediator and
surety of the covenant, to mine.</p>
<p>"I am afflicted with rheumatism, but God gives me patience,
disposes me to enumerate my many remaining mercies &mdash; eyes to
read his word and ears to hear it preached; hitherto such
moderation of pain as very often to be able to attend with
fixedness. I have my room at my own command, candle, fire, and
attendance; and O, bless the Lord, my soul, much of his sensible
presence. In the night when my aches prevent me from sleeping, he

journey in the wilderness and through Jordan, is selected by the
influence of the Holy Ghost. He takes of the things of Christ and
shows them unto me; and while he keeps upon my mind my meanness, my
vileness, wrings my heart with the retrospect of my backslidings
and highly aggravated transgressions, he opens at the same time the
leaves of the New Testament and shows me my deliverance from
punishment, the redemption of my soul, and my translation into the

<p>"True, my heart accords. O Lord, thou knowest I stand in my own
estimation a sinner, the chief of sinners. These have added to
their sin against thee, breach against men, and are suffering the
penalty.</p>
<p>"My sins have been chiefly, though far from exclusively, against
God, and with many aggravations. That I was born in a Christian
land, of pious parents, who gave me religious instructions; brought
up under faithful, lively ministers, and in religious society;
exposed to few temptations but what arose from the corruptions of
my own heart, are aggravations, which, perhaps, many are mourning
over, as heightening the sin of unbelief in their unregenerated
state. But the aggravations &mdash; the painful remembrance of
which mars my comfort and covers me with shame and confusion even
now, though I know that God is pacified with me &mdash; are as far
above these as the heavens are above the earth. For in that
Christian land, under those Christian parents and faithful pastors,
while yet young and tender, I was enlightened, tasted of the
heavenly gift, was made a partaker of the Holy Ghost, tasted of the
good word of God and the power of the world to come. I was taken
from the fearful pit and miry clay; my feet set upon the rock, and
a new song put into my mouth, even to the amount of, O death, where
is thy sting? &mdash; of redeeming love, pardoning grace, new
covenant mercy, I had 'joy and peace in believing,' But forgetting
my natural character, the extreme volatility of my spirits, my
taste for gayety; forgetting <!--Page 324--><a name="P324" id=
"P324"></a> the danger of smothering the heavenly spark by
indulging to the utmost bound of lawful pleasure; forgetting my
continual need of fresh supplies of grace to preserve and feed that
new life which could not live on earthly food; forgetting the
deceitfulness of my heart, the injunctions of my Bible, I became
cold, negligent in the use of means, distant in prayer, lost
enjoyment, and my heart, naturally carnal and madly fond of
pleasure, got entangled. 'The lust of the flesh, the lust of the
eye, and the pride of life' regained their power; other loves
usurped the place of that Beloved who had bought me with his blood,
and betrothed me to himself; 'that which came into my mind was,
that I would be as the families of the countries, to serve wood and
stone.' Blessed be his name, he said, 'It shall not be.' He brought
me into the wilderness and pleaded with me, caused me to pass under
the rod, brought me again into the bond of the covenant.</p>
<p>"O how often hast thou wrought with me, for thy name's sake. One
self-willed step brought with it a train of consequences dangerous
to spiritual life, filling even the path of duty with pits and
snares, cutting me off from ordinances, pastor, parents, church,
country, and Christian society; placing me at the same time in the
midst of carnal delights; and every thing in my natural temper and
dispositions was congenial to them. What saved me? What in heaven
or earth could save me, but thy covenant? Truly thy covenant
standeth fast; therefore I was not lost in the vortex. But 'the
Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in
goodness and truth, forgiving iniquity, transgression, and sin,'
kept his eye upon me; many a time did he stop up my path. O from
how <!--Page 325--><a name="P325" id="P325"></a> many delusions
of my own seeking; how many snares and nets of my own weaving; how
many pits of my own digging, hast thou delivered me, when
wandering, bewildered, on temptation's ground, in the cloudy dark
day. How often hast thou sought me out; how often bound me up when
broken, strengthened me when sick, and fed me with judgment, and
very, very often, thou madest thyself known to me. I knew thy hand
when it shook the rod, when it arrested me on some mad career. I
knew thy hedge, thy bar; saw not only escapes, but my Deliverer:
often paused, turned, and took fast hold of thy covenant. I had no
afflictions in those days, but every pleasure lawful to be enjoyed,
and natural to the heart of woman; but no pastor, no church, no
Christian society; yet God was there, my Bible, my Doddridge, and
other good books. And to my shame and confusion this day, he was
not, in the midst of all my idolatry, a barren wilderness, nor a
land of drought to me. I had many Sabbaths; literally the Sabbath
was a sign between my covenant God and me: ill spent it often was,
but not with company; it was spent in retirement. The Lord did not
leave me so far as to give up the Sabbath to the world. Though my
heart was incrusted, and spiritual life scarcely discernible,
sometimes the Lord met me, and strange to tell, not with
threatenings causing terror, but with compunction, melting,
turning, and ere the day was over, manifestations of pardon, though
not joy; for I was grieved at my ingratitude.</p>
<p>"I did expect affliction long before it came, and my
presumptuous heart calculated upon the fruit being the peaceable
fruit of righteousness, and to take away sin; but still I held my
way, gadding about, drinking <!--Page 326--><a name="P326" id=
"P326"></a> the waters of Sihor and the rivers of Syria, and
eating the worldling's dainties. Oh, Oh, at last it came; yes, it
came. Thou didst cut off the desire of my eyes with a stroke, and
with that made the world a blank to me. But O the stately steps of
thy providential mercy previous to that trying hour. O my God, I
must ever wonder and stand amazed at thy exuberant grace. In
consistence with thy covenant, thou mightest have struck me among
these worldlings, in that dry and barren land, where not one tongue
could speak the language of Canaan, nor bring forth from thy
precious Bible the words of consolation to my wounded and bereaved
spirit; richly had I merited this; but never, no, never hast thou
dealt with me as I sinned. Through the whole of my life, from the
time that the Lord called me out of darkness into his marvellous
light &mdash; from the time that he first led me to the Saviour,
and enabled me to take hold of his covenant, wanderer, backslider,
transgressor, rebel, idolater, ingrate, and if there be any name
more expressively <i>vile</i> and <i>abominable</i>, that is mine.
And from the hour of my birth, through the whole of this refractory
perverse life, 'the Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious,

transgression, and sin,' has been, and now is, thy name to me.</p>
<p>"No, ye strong-built walls, ye grated windows, ye gloomy cells,
ye confine no such sinner as I. And did the Lord take vengeance on
my inventions? O no, <i>mercy</i> preceded, <i>mercy</i>
accompanied judgment; yea, it was all mercy, not vengeance. He
brought me and my idol out of that barren land, placed us under the
breath of prayer, among a dear little society
<!--Page 327--><a name="P327" id="P327"></a> of Methodists; he
laid us upon their spirits, and when the messenger Death was sent
for my beloved, the breath of prayer ascended from his bedside,
from their little meeting, and I believe from their families and
closets. The God of mercy prepared their hearts to pray, and his
ear to hear, and the answer did not tarry. Behold, my husband
prayeth; confesses sin; applies to the Saviour; pleads for
forgiveness for his sake; receives comfort; blesses God for Jesus
Christ, and dies with these words on his tongue, 'I hold fast by
the Saviour,' Behold another wonder; the idolatress in an ecstasy
of joy. She who never could realize a separation for one single
minute during his life, now resigns her heart's treasure with
praise and thanksgiving.</p>
<p>"O the joy of that hour; its savor remains on my heart to this
moment. For five days and nights I had been little off my knees: it
was my ordinary posture at his bedside, and in all that time I had
but <i>once</i> requested life. Surely the spirit of prayer and
supplication was poured out. The Spirit helped mine infirmities
with groanings which could not be uttered, leading me to pray for
that which God had determined to bestow; making intercession for my
husband, according to the will of God.</p>
<p>"O sing unto the Lord a new song, for he hath done marvellous
things. His right hand and his holy arm hath gotten him the
victory. The Lord hath made known his salvation. His righteousness
hath he openly shown in the sight of the heathen. He hath
remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel. All
the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God."

God, received by the sinner. Life and comfort are experienced, and
fruit produced is the evidence; but first of all, this gift must be
known, and the soul's need must be known; Christ, the anointed
prophet, taught this woman both, and no other could. 'Search me, O
Lord, and try me.' Hast thou not taught my soul its miserable and
ruined state by nature; its helplessness as well as misery? Hast
thou not also brought me to this living, life-giving water? Oh,
hast thou not given me faith to come, faith to drink; and have I
not experienced its solacing quality? Has it not satisfied my soul,
and in some degree allayed my thirst for carnal delights? Blessed
Spirit, the gift of the Father and of the Son, pour into my soul
repeated draughts of this living water; yea, be in me, according to

take hold of this thy own covenant, and to give themselves to thee
to be made the subjects of it. And now, O Lord, remember thy own

and write them in their hearts, and be unto them a God, and they
shall be unto thee a people; be merciful to their unrighteousness,
and their sins and their iniquities remember no more. Give them
understanding to know and believe thy laws, memories to retain
them, hearts to love them, consciences to recognize them, courage

dost not unto the world. Blessed Shepherd, call these lambs by
name; may they know thy voice, rejoice to hear it, and follow thee.

prospect from my windows such as I have ever delighted in, woods

various kinds, all as much mine as if my own individual property by
the laws of the land in which I live; surrounded with books, and my
children's rich library at my command; enjoying rich gospel
ordinances, under a godly, gifted pastor, with pious, loving,
sensible church-members; a carriage to convey me, Sabbath and
week-days, to places of worship; children whose desire is that I
may enjoy all these to the full without care or trouble, they
caring for me; with all these a large measure of health, my eyes
see my teachers, my ears hear their voice. Why then these tears?
Are they all for sin? Lord, search and see. Does no wounded pride,
no selfish hurt mix? Ah, Lord, thou knowest. I have detected much,
and mourn and weep on that account; but I fear there is yet much
lurking and working that I know not.</p>
<p>"I have set apart the remainder of this day for
<!--Page 337--><a name="P337" id="P337"></a> fasting and
humiliation on account of past sins which I already know, and for
yet further search into what I know not of at present. Lord, give
me heart-searching exercises. Glory, glory, glory to Father, Son,
and blessed Comforter, that I am forgiven; thy Spirit witnesseth
with my spirit that I am forgiven. Thou hast given me faith in the
truth of thy testimony, that the blood of Christ cleanseth from all
sin &mdash; that this is thy own provision for sinners &mdash; that
Christ died for the ungodly &mdash; that while we were yet sinners,
Christ died for us &mdash; that Christ hath loved us, and given
himself for us &mdash; that 'God so loved the world that he gave
his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not
perish, but have everlasting life.' These last words came from thy
own lips of flesh. Thou gift of God to a perishing world, and to
me, one of the most guilty in it, thou also saidst, 'He that
believeth on the Son hath everlasting life.' Thy Spirit witnesseth
with my spirit, that to me it is given on the behalf of Christ to
believe in him. Phil. 1:29. Therefore I have everlasting life. Him
who was slain and hanged on a tree, 'Him hath God exalted to be a
Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance and remission of
sins.' From this exalted Prince I have repentance and forgiveness
of sin, and therefore I dare look at my sins: I look with grief,
but not with terror. Though forgiven, and though provision is made
for forgiveness, sin is still an evil and a bitter thing.</p>
<p>"This day is set apart for mourning. I desire to search, to know
more of my vileness, that I may mourn yet more; that while my heart
is wrung for my ingratitude, the Lord may make it the means of
crucifying <!--Page 338--><a name="P338" id="P338"></a> my sins,
especially that which so easily besets me, that he will give me the
prayer of faith that they may be forgiven, and that I may be
delivered from their power in my heart; that I may be clothed with
humility, so humble that nothing can hurt me, wearing my Redeemer's

purification and the, means appointed by God. The blood of Christ
is the only effectual means not only as atonement for sin, setting
us free from condemnation, but also for cleansing, as sprinkled on
the conscience by the Holy Ghost, and purging it from dead works.
There are means in which we are to exercise ourselves, depending on
the Spirit for benefit. We are to work in the faith that God works
in us. Mortification is one means, and though the mortification of
the body is perhaps one of the lowest, I think it is of divine
appointment, therefore not to be neglected. I have been also
studying the death of Christ, and his previous sufferings; the
unbelief, the opposition, contradiction, contempt, and cruel
mocking which he endured; and his meekness, patience, and
submission under them; healing Malchus' ear, praying for his
murderers; that, as the children of Israel were healed by looking
to the brazen serpent, I may be healed by looking unto the uplifted
Jesus; the Spirit producing the effect. And as the
<!--Page 339--><a name="P339" id="P339"></a> woman with the
bloody issue was healed by a touch, exercising faith in the power
of Christ, so I may be healed by a look, exercising the same faith,
the Spirit producing the effect of conformity to his example,
working in me that meek and lowly spirit for which I have been
praying. And now, by grace communicated, I hope to watch over my

<p>"I know not, my dear, the amount of that over which you mourn
with so much agony; I know not even if it be sinful, except in the
circumstances; you are conscious of sincerity, and you do not now
wish to draw back. We can, my dear, do nothing in our own strength;
no, not so much as think a good thought. To make any resolution
without dependence on God for strength to perform, is sinful; to
make any vow without a consciousness of our weakness and dependence
on God for strength to perform, is an aggravation of the evil.</p>
<p>"I suppose my J&mdash;&mdash; has sinned; what then? If any man say he has
no sin, he deceives himself, and <!--Page 340--><a name="P340" id=

your sin in this is greater than many other sins with their
aggravations, you judge wrong. I think that any one
<i>deliberate</i> sin, wilfully committed with a knowledge that it
is sin, is greater than yours in such circumstances. You are bound
by your vow, and God will enable you to perform it. Turn, my dear,
to the second chapter of the Acts of the Apostles, where Peter
preaches to the very murderers of our blessed Saviour, and charges
the guilt upon them, verse twenty-second; and again in verse
thirty-sixth, 'Therefore let all the house of Israel know
assuredly, that this same Jesus whom ye crucified, God hath made
both Lord and Christ; and when they heard this, they were pricked
in their hearts.' Read on, my dear; Peter exhorts even them to
repent and be baptized in the name of Christ, for the remission of
sins. I make no doubt but many have made vows in a rash manner;
but, so far as I know, you have vowed only to serve the Lord; this
you are bound to do with or without a vow; and if the Lord makes
this vow the means of keeping you watchful and humble, and firm in
avoiding what you have vowed against, it will, by his overruling
Spirit, prove a blessing.</p>
<p>"You 'do not know where to look for comfort!' To, Jesus, my
dear; not to yourself, nor to any creature. 'Look unto me and be ye
saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none
else.' Isa. 45:22. 'O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself, but in
me is thy help.' Hosea 13:9; chap. 14. Take a view, my dear, of the
character of God in his dealings with his perverse Israel, after
they had made the molten calf, and sinned otherwise grievously
against <!--Page 341--><a name="P341" id="P341"></a> God. He, at
the intercession of Moses, forgave their sin, and proclaimed that
wonderful name, which to this day is the encouragement of convicted
sinners, and mine in particular. And the Lord passed by him (Moses)
and proclaimed, 'The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious,
long-suffering, abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for
thousands, forgiving iniquity, transgression, and sin.' And how can
God do this, whose law is, as himself, immutable; and who adds
'that he will by no means clear the guilty?' Exodus 34:6. Look now
to the fifty-third chapter of Isaiah, where you will find your
Redeemer standing in your stead. In the thirtieth chapter is
another amazing display of God's forgiveness. The prophet begins
the chapter with, 'Woe to the rebellious children!' and lays
grievous things to their charge till you come to the eighteenth
verse, where he says, 'Therefore will the Lord wait, that he may be
gracious to you; therefore will he be exalted, that he may have
mercy upon you; for the Lord is a God of judgment, blessed are all
they that wait for him.' Once more look at the proclamation,
Jeremiah 3:12. God has provided a sacrifice of sufficient value to
atone for our most aggravated transgressions, and a righteousness
answerable to the uttermost extent of his holy law. Both are made
over to the sinner by free gift. 'He hath made him to be sin for
us, who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God
in him.' 2 Cor. 5:21. <i>In Him</i> &mdash; He, our surety, having
fulfilled all righteousness for us, <i>as</i> our surety and
representative.</p>
<p>"You fear that it is not the hand of the Lord that is upon you.
I do think that it is, my J&mdash;&mdash;. It is <!--Page 342--><a name=
"P342" id="P342"></a> the peculiar office of the Spirit to
convince of sin, and I do think that he is at this time dealing
with your soul. But why look so much at your vow? you have sinned,
my J&mdash;&mdash;, in heart, lip, and life. 'Thou shalt love the Lord thy
God with all thy heart.' O my J&mdash;&mdash;, what prostituted affections,
what misspent time. While God says, 'Whether you eat or drink, or
whatsoever you do, do all to the glory of God,' what
self-indulgence and self-will, instead of self-denial. Listen to
the voice of convictions, listen to it as the voice of mercy,
leading you to Christ the great propitiatory sacrifice, 'the Lamb
of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.'</p>
<p>"Go to Christ, my dear, as a sinner; tell him you commit your
sinful soul into his hands; say, Thou hast bid me look unto thee
and be saved. Saviour, I do look unto thee for salvation. Wash me
in thy blood, clothe me in thy righteousness, sanctify me by thy
grace, accept of me as thy pardoned, saved child; and be a surety
for me for good, that having vowed to thee that I would be thy
servant, I may perform my vow; furnish me with both will and power
to devote myself to thee every day of my life.</p>
<p>"Try, my dear, to rest on Christ; put your trust in him; if you
do he will not disappoint you; as your faith, so shall it be unto
you. Now faith is a saving grace; thereby we receive and rest upon
Christ for salvation, as he is offered to us in the gospel. Do as
you have said: wait his appointed time, in the use of means, till
he manifest himself to you. I am hurried for time to get this to
town. Farewell. I will pray for you.</p>

<p>"'A day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick
darkness, as the morning spread upon the mountains.'
Joel&nbsp;2:2.</p>
<p>"Not in temporals, nor in the means of grace; every thing that
earth can afford is gathered into my present cup; it is full and
runs over with earthly good, and a large measure of health to enjoy
it. Moral temporals are also mine in no common degree, friendship,
society at my choice, and respectability in it. Rich means of grace
within my reach, my Bible, and books of every kind and great
variety at my hand, of instruction and of devotion. Mine eyes see
my teachers, and my judgment approves their doctrine as
corresponding with that sure word of testimony given me as the test
of all human writings. Yet it is a day of darkness and of
gloom.</p>
<p>"'Who is among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice
of his servant, that walketh in darkness and hath no light? Let him
trust in the name of the Lord and stay upon his God.'
Isa.&nbsp;50:10.</p>
<p>"To trust in the name of the Lord and to stay myself upon my God
is still my privilege, and though with little life and little
comfort, my experience. My mind is so desultory! My Bible, and
helps derived from men's deductions and experiences, seem useless;
they are not blessed as means to fix my heart; trifles of every
sort pass and repass often; while my eyes read the words, my mind
is gone in a dream on some other subject; my heart remains
unimpressed, my mind uninformed; the same in prayer, especially in
secret and in the family; less so in the sanctuary.</p>
<p>"I seem, as to apprehension, left to my own dark,
<!--Page 344--><a name="P344" id="P344"></a> dismal, carnal
self; naked faith on the finished work of my Redeemer is all that
supports me; and that as a bare preventive of fear and source of a
hope that 'I shall yet praise Him who is the health of my
countenance and my God.' I know his covenant stands fast, I have
taken hold of it; I do at this cold and stupid moment place my
confidence in it. Christ is God's covenant, God's gift to sinners;
I believe it; he is the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of
the world; I believe it; I believe on the Son for all the purposes
for which God has sent him into the world; therefore I have
everlasting life; I believe the record that God gave of his Son;
that God hath given to me eternal life, and this life is in his
Son, not in me, but in union with him. 'He that hath the Son hath
life; he that hath not the Son, hath not life.' John&nbsp;5.</p>
<p>"I thank thee, my God, that thou hast not left me to cast away
my confidence in Christ. I have life in him, and no life but as I
have it from him. Thou seest how it is with me. Thou art my
reconciled Father in Christ, but thou hast shut me out from thy
presence. I do not enjoy thee; my poor heart is tossed from trifle
to trifle. It has been my way through life to destroy myself, and
thy way to deliver me. Thou hast been very gracious to me in my old
age. I have enjoyed much of thy presence in thy sanctuary and in my
private hours; and although sin has dwelt and does dwell in me, I
have enjoyed thy forgiving grace, and have tasted thy love, far
beyond what I have for weeks past. 'Search me, O God, and know my
heart; try me and know my thoughts; and see if there be any wicked
way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.' Show me wherefore
thou contendest <!--Page 345--><a name="P345" id="P345"></a>
with me. Am I living in the indulgence of any known wilful sin; or
in the habitual neglect of any known duty? Lord, 'it is not in man
that walketh to direct his steps.' I know I have been unthankful,
unwatchful, idle; alas, this is my ordinary course; but it is not
the ordinary course of my Lord God, merciful and gracious, to mark
iniquity against me, but to forgive me daily, to lead me to the
blood of sprinkling, to give me contrition, and to restore me to
his favor by giving me 'joy and peace in believing.' Help, Lord;
give me heart-searching exercises. I read thy word, I set about
that to which thou callest me. I set apart this day for fasting,
but the gracious exercises are not in me. Come, O come, and be with
me. Exalted Prince, give repentance and remission; in thy light let
me see light.</p>
<p>"'Therefore now turn ye unto me with all your heart, with
fasting, with weeping and mourning; rend your heart and not your
garments, turn unto the Lord your God; for he is gracious and
merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repenteth him
of the evil.' Joel 2:12. O, do I not know thee by this name; has it
not been thy name to me throughout this wide wilderness, 'pardoning
iniquity, transgression, and sin?' Thou hast prepared a prayer for
me, 'Turn me, and I shall be turned, for thou art the Lord my God.'
Jer. 31:18. I look to thy new covenant in the same chapter; it is
all promise, I can do nothing in it. Christ by thine own
appointment answers for my part; or rather, I have no part. I can
render nothing to the Lord for all his benefits to me. I will put
forth the withered hand to 'take the cup of salvation, and call on
the name of the Lord.'</p>
<!--Page 346--><a name="P346" id="P346"></a>
<p>"Ten o'clock. The day is spent; I have confessed, and endeavored
to turn to the Lord with mourning, but with little sensibility.</p>
<p>"I attended meeting in the evening, heard two excellent
discourses on the priesthood of Christ, and joined in two prayers
and three hymns with more fixed attention than has been my
attainment lately; for this I thank thee, my God. Many have been
the beginnings of days and of months which thou hast afforded after
backsliding. O add this to the number. 'Hear my prayer, O Lord;
give ear to my supplications; in thy faithfulness answer me, and in
thy righteousness. Enter not into judgment with thy servant, for in
thy sight shall no man living be justified.' Psalm&nbsp;143.</p>
<p>"My spirit is overwhelmed within me, my heart within me is
desolate. I stretch out my hands unto thee; my soul thirsteth after
thee in a thirsty land. Hear me speedily, O Lord; my spirit
faileth; hide not thy face from me, lest I be like unto those that
go down into the pit. Cause me to hear thy loving-kindness in the
morning, for in thee do I trust; cause me to know the way wherein I
should walk, for I lift up my soul unto thee. Deliver me, O Lord,
from mine enemies; I flee unto thee to hide me. Teach me to do thy
will, for thou art my God. Thy Spirit is good; lead me into the
land of uprightness. Quicken me, O Lord, for thy name's sake; for
thy righteousness' sake bring my soul out of trouble. I wait for
thy salvation.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII.</h3>
<h4>CLOSING LABORS FOR THE POOR &mdash; SICKNESS AND DEATH.</h4>
<p>D<font size="-1">URING</font> the last two years of her life,
Mrs. Graham found her strength inadequate to so extensive a course
of visiting the poor as formerly; there were some distressed
families, however, that experienced her kind attentions to the
last. She would occasionally accompany the Rev. Mr. Stanford on his
visits to the state-prison, hospital, and to the Magdalen house.
This gentleman was the stated preacher employed by "the Society for
the Support of the Gospel among the Poor," and devoted his time to
preaching in the almshouse, hospital, state-prison,
debtors'-prison, etc., with great assiduity and acceptance.</p>
<p>Mrs. Graham now spent much of her time in her room, devoted to
meditation, prayer, and reading the Scriptures; she seemed to be
weaning from earth and preparing for heaven. Prayer was that sweet
breath of her soul which brought stability to her life. Genuine
humility was obvious in all her sentiments and deportment.
Religious friends prized her conversation, counsel, and friendship;
sometimes they would venture on a compliment to her superior
attainments, but always experienced a decided rebuke. To her friend
Colonel L&mdash;&mdash;, who expressed a wish to be such a character as she
was, she quickly replied with an air of mingled pleasantry and
censure, "Get thee behind me, Satan." To a female friend who said,
"If I were only sure at last of being admitted to a place
<!--Page 349--><a name="P349" id="P349"></a> at your feet I
should feel happy." "Hush, hush," replied Mrs. Graham, "There is
<font size="-1">ONE</font> S<font size="-1">AVIOUR</font>." Thus
she was always careful to give her divine Redeemer the whole glory
of her salvation.</p>
<p>This example of humility, self-denial, and sensibility to the
imperfection of her conduct, is the more to be valued, as it is so
difficult to be followed. Flattery is too commonly practised; and
there is no sufficient guard against its dangerous consequences,
except a constant and humbling recognition of the spirituality of
the law of God, and our lamentable deficiency in fulfilling it.
Pride was not made for man: "I have seen an end of all perfection,"
said the Psalmist, "but thy commandment is exceeding broad." It was
by cherishing this sentiment, by studying her Bible, by searching
her heart and its motives, and above all, by grace accorded of
heaven in answer to her prayers, that Mrs. Graham was enabled to
maintain such meekness of spirit, such an uniformity of Christian
character throughout her life. May all who read her history be
directed to the same sources of true peace and genuine
happiness.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1814 she was requested to unite with some
ladies in forming a society for the promotion of industry among the
poor. This was the last act in which she appeared before the
public. A petition, signed by about thirty ladies, was presented to
the corporation of New York, praying that they would assign them a
building in which work might be prepared and given out to the
industrious poor, who being paid for their labor, might be saved
the necessity of begging, and at the same time cherish habits of
industry and self-respect. The corporation having returned
<!--Page 350--><a name="P350" id="P350"></a> a favorable answer,
and provided a house, a meeting of the Society was held, and Mrs.
Graham once more was called to the chair. It was the last time she
was to preside at the formation of a new society. Her articulation,
once strong and clear, was now observed to have become more feeble.
The ladies present listened to her with affectionate attention; her
voice broke upon the ear as a pleasant sound that was passing away.
She consented to have her name inserted on the list of managers,
and to give what assistance her age would permit in forwarding so
beneficent a work. Although it pleased God that she should cease
from her labors before the House of Industry was opened, yet the
work was carried on by others and prospered. Between four and five
hundred women were employed and paid during the following winter.
The corporation declared in strong terms their approbation of the
result, and enlarged their donation, with a view to promote the
same undertaking for the succeeding winter.</p>
<p>In the month of May, 1814, a report was received from Mr.
Stephen Prust of Bristol, in England, of the Society for
establishing Adult-schools. Mrs. Graham was so delighted with a
perusal of it, as immediately to undertake the formation of such a
school in the village of Greenwich. She called on the young people
who were at work in some neighboring manufactories, and requested
them to attend her for this purpose every Sabbath morning at eight
o'clock. This was kept up after her decease as a Sunday-school, and
consisted of nearly eighty scholars. She was translated from this
work of faith on earth, to engage in the sublimer work of praise in
heaven.</p>
<!--Page 351--><a name="P351" id="P351"></a>
<p>For some weeks previous to her last illness she was favored with
unusual health and much enjoyment of religion; she appeared to have
sweet exercises and communion in attending on all God's ordinances
and appointed means of grace. She was also greatly refreshed in
spirit by the success of Missionary and Bible Societies, and used
to speak with much affection of Mr. Gordon, Mr. Lee, Mr. May, and
Dr. Morrison, with whom she had been acquainted when in New York,
on their way to missionary stations in India and China.</p>
<p>Mrs. Graham was very partial to the works of Dr. John Owen, Rev.
William Romaine, and Rev. John Newton, and read them with pleasure
and profit. One day she remarked to Mr. B&mdash;&mdash;, that she preferred
the ancient writers on theology to the modern, because they dealt
more in italics. "Dear mother," he replied, "what religion can
there be in italics?" "You know," said she, "that old writers
expected credit for the doctrines they taught, by proving them from
the word of God to be correct: they inserted the scripture passages
in italics, and their works have been sometimes one-half in
italics. Modern writers on theology, on the contrary, give us a
long train of reasoning to persuade us to their opinions, but very
little in italics." This remark of hers has great force, and
deserves the serious attention of those who write and those who
read on theological subjects.</p>
<p>On the two Sabbaths preceding her last illness she joined in
communion at the Lord's table. On the 10th of July, 1814, at
Greenwich, and on the 17th at her own church in Cedar-street. On
each week preceding these seasons she attended three evenings on
religious exercises; on Thursdays at the Orphan Asylum,
<!--Page 352--><a name="P352" id="P352"></a> on Friday evenings
the preparation sermons, and on Saturday evenings at the
prayer-meetings. She appeared lively, and expressed comfort in
those religious seasons, and continued actively useful until the
very day on which her illness commenced.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 17th she attended the Sabbath-school with
her daughter and grandchildren. Thus the Lord was pleased to direct
that she should lead her children's children into the walks of
usefulness before she took her flight to heaven, and impose a
pleasing obligation on them that they should follow her steps. Of
the same date is the last meditation in her diary.</p>
<br />
<p class="right">"C<font size="-1">OMMUNION</font> S<font size=
"-1">ABBATH</font>, July 17, 1814.</p>
<p>"'Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him
not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of
glory: receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your
souls,' 1&nbsp;Peter, 1:8,&nbsp;9.</p>
<p>"I had requested to be brought to my Lord's banqueting-house,
and to be feasted with love this day. I ate the bread and drank the
wine, in the faith that I ate the flesh and drank the blood of the
Son of man, and dwelt in him and he in me. Took a close view of my
familiar friend Death, accompanied with the presence of my Saviour,
<i>his sensible presence</i>. I cannot look at it without this; it
is my only petition concerning it. I have had desires relative to
certain circumstances, but they are nearly gone. It is my sincere
desire that God may be glorified, and he knows best how and by what
circumstances. I retain my one petition,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>"Only to me thy countenance
show,<br /></span> <span>I ask no more the Jordan
through."<br /></span></div>
</div>
<!--Page 353--><a name="P353" id="P353"></a>
<p>Thus she arose from her Master's table, was called to gird on
her armor for a combat with the king of terrors, and came off more
than conqueror, through Him who loved her.</p>
<p>On Monday she appeared in perfect health, and visited and gave
religious instruction to the orphans in the asylum.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the 19th of July, she complained of not feeling
well, and kept her room; on Thursday her disorder proved to be a
cholera-morbus, and her children sent for a physician. She thought
this attack was slighter than in former seasons. On Saturday,
however, she requested that Mrs. Chrystie might be sent for; this
alarmed Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash;, knowing there existed an understanding between
those two friends, that one should attend the dying-bed of the
other, Mrs. Chrystie was a very dear friend of Mrs. Graham. For
upwards of twenty-four years they had loved each other, feeling
reciprocal sympathy in their joys and their sorrows; the hope of
faith was the consolation of both, and oftentimes it had been their
delightful employment to interchange their expressions of affection
towards Him whom having not seen, they loved, and in whom, though
they saw him not, yet believing on him, they rejoiced with joy
unspeakable and full of glory. On Mrs. Chrystie's entering the
chamber of her friend, Mrs. Graham welcomed her with a sweet
expressive smile, seeming to say, "I am going to get the start of
you, I am called home before you; it will be your office to fulfil
our engagement." When she sat by her bedside, Mrs. Graham said,
"Your face is very pleasant to me, my friend."</p>
<!--Page 354--><a name="P354" id="P354"></a>
<p>During Saturday night, a lethargy appeared to be overpowering
her frame. On Sabbath morning she was disposed to constant slumber;
observing Mr. B&mdash;&mdash; looking at her with agitation, she was roused
from her heaviness, and stretching her arms towards him and
embracing him, she said, "My dear, dear son, I am going to leave
you; I am going to my Saviour." "I know," he replied, "that when
you do go from us, it will be to the Saviour; but, my dear mother,
it may not be the Lord's time now to call you to himself." "Yes,"
said she, "now is the time; and Oh, I could weep for sin." Her
words were accompanied with her tears. "Have you any doubts, then,
my dear friend?" asked Mrs. Chrystie. "Oh no," replied Mrs. Graham;
and looking at Mr. and Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash; as they wept, "My dear children,
I have no more doubt of going to my Saviour, than if I were already
in his arms; my guilt is all transferred; he has cancelled all I
owed. Yet I could weep for sins against so good a God: it seems to
me as if there must be weeping even in heaven for sin."</p>
<p>After this she entered into conversation with her friends,
mentioning portions of scripture and favorite hymns which had been
subjects of much comfort and joy to her. Some of these she had
transcribed into a little book, calling them her "victuals"
prepared for crossing over Jordan; she committed them to memory,
and often called them to remembrance as her songs in the night when
sleep had deserted her. She then got Mr. B&mdash;&mdash; to read to her some
of these portions, especially the eighty-second hymn of Newton's
third book:</p>
<!--Page 355--><a name="P355" id="P355"></a>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>"Let us love, and sing, and
wonder;<br /></span> <span class="i2">Let us praise the Saviour's
name:<br /></span> <span>He has hushed the law's loud
thunder,<br /></span> <span class="i2">He has quenched mount
Sinai's flame:<br /></span> <span class="i2">He has washed us with
his blood,<br /></span> <span class="i2">He has brought us nigh to
God," etc.<br /></span></div>
</div>
<p>Mrs. Graham then fell asleep, nor did she awaken until the voice
of the Rev. Dr. Mason roused her. They had a very affectionate
interview, which he has partly described in the excellent sermon he
delivered after her decease. She expressed to him her hope as
founded altogether on the redemption that is in Jesus Christ: were
she left to depend on the merit of the best action she had ever
performed, that would be only a source of despair. She repeated to
him, as her view of salvation, the fourth verse of the same
hymn:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>"Let us wonder: grace and
justice<br /></span> <span class="i2">Join, and point at mercy's
store;<br /></span> <span>When, through grace, in Christ our trust
is,<br /></span> <span class="i2">Justice smiles and asks no
more;<br /></span> <span class="i2">He who washed us with his
blood,<br /></span> <span class="i2">Has secured our way to
God."<br /></span></div>
</div>
<p>Having asked Dr. Mason to pray with her, he inquired if there
was any particular request she had to make of God by him; she
replied, that God would direct: then as he kneeled, she put up her
hands, and raising her eyes towards heaven, breathed this short but
expressive petition, "Lord, lead thy servant in prayer."</p>
<p>After Dr. Mason had taken his leave, she again fell into a deep
sleep. Her physicians still expressed a hope of her recovery, as
her pulse was regular and the violence of her disease had abated.
One of them, however, declared his opinion that his poor drugs
would prove of little avail against her own ardent
<!--Page 356--><a name="P356" id="P356"></a> prayers to depart
and be with Christ, which was far better for her than a return to a
dying world.</p>
<p>On Monday the Rev. Mr. Rowan prayed with her, and to him she
expressed also the tranquillity of her mind, and the steadfastness
of her hope, through Christ, of eternal felicity.</p>
<p>Her lethargy increased; at intervals from sleep she would
occasionally assure her daughter, Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash;, that all was well;
and when she could rouse herself only to say one word at a time,
that one word, accompanied with a smile, was, "Peace." From her
there was a peculiar emphasis in this expression of the state of
her mind: "Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you," had
been a favorite portion of scripture with her, and a promise, the
fulfilment of which was her earnest prayer to the God who made it.
She also occasionally asked Mr. B&mdash;&mdash; to pray with her, even when
she could only articulate, as she looked at him, "Pray." She was
now surrounded by many of her dear Christian friends, who watched
her dying-bed with affection and solicitude. On Tuesday afternoon
she slept with little intermission. This, said Dr. Mason, may be
truly called "falling asleep in Jesus." It was remarked by those
who attended her, that all terror was taken away, and that death
seemed here as an entrance into life. Her countenance was placid,
and looked younger than before her illness.</p>
<p>At a quarter past twelve o'clock, being the morning of the 27th
of July, 1814, her spirit gently winged its flight from a mansion
of clay to the realms of glory, while around the precious remnant
of earth her family and friends stood weeping, yet elevated by the
<!--Page 357--><a name="P357" id="P357"></a> scene they were
witnessing. After a silence of many minutes, they kneeled by her
bed, adored the goodness and the grace of God towards his departed
child, and implored the divine blessing on both the branches of her
family, as well as on all the Israel of God.</p>
<p>Thus she departed in peace, not trusting in her wisdom or
virtue, like the philosophers of Greece and Rome; not even like
Addison, calling on the profligate to see a good man die; but like
Howard, afraid that her good works might have a wrong place in the
estimate of her hope, her chief glory was that of "a sinner saved
by grace."*</p>
<p class="note">*This was Howard's epitaph, dictated by
himself.</p>
<p>After such examples, who will dare to charge the doctrines of
the cross of Christ with licentiousness? Here are two instances of
persons, to whose good works the world have cheerfully borne
testimony, who lived and died in the profession of these doctrines.
It was faith that first purified their hearts, and so the stream of
action from these fountains became pure also. Had not Christ died
and risen again, all the powers of man could never have produced
such lives of benevolence, nor a death so full of contrition, yet
so embalmed with hope. Hallelujah, "unto Him who loved us, and
washed us from our sins in his own blood, and hath made us kings
and priests unto God and his Father: to him be glory and dominion,
for ever and ever.&emsp;Amen."</p>
<p>At the next weekly prayer-meeting which she had usually
attended, the circumstances of her death were made subjects of
improvement. On the 16th of July she was a worshipper with her
brethren and sisters <!--Page 358--><a name="P358" id=
"P358"></a> there, and on the evening of the 30th they were
called to consider her by faith as in the immediate presence of her
God, among "the spirits of the just made perfect." The services of
that evening were closed with the following hymn from Dobell's
collection, which is beautifully descriptive of her happy
change:</p>
<div class="poem">

past,<br /></span> <span class="i2">The heaven-born spirit is

<p>Mrs. Graham's death created a strong sensation in the public
mind. Magistrates of the city were careful to express their sense
of the public loss sustained, and many charitable institutions paid
affectionate tributes to her memory. Several clergymen also made
her death the subject of their discourses, among whom was her
beloved pastor, Dr. J<font size="-1">OHN</font> M. M<font size=
"-1">ASON</font>, who, on Sabbath evening, Aug. 14, delivered the
well-known powerful sermon, "C<font size="-1">HRISTIAN</font>
M<font size="-1">OURNING</font>," from 1&nbsp;Thess. 4:13,&nbsp;14:
"I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them
which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no
hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so
them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him."</p>
<p>Contrasting the consolations afforded to the Christian with the
darkness and doubt of the pagan or infidel; dwelling on the
Christian's death as "sleeping in Jesus;" his immediate entrance
into bliss, and his glorious resurrection and reigning with Christ
in the judgment, he thus proceeds:</p>
<p>"In this faith the apostles labored and the martyrs bled. Ages
have elapsed and it is still the same. It is not a distant wonder;
not a brilliant vision; but a solid and present reality, under the
power of which at this moment, while the words are on my lips,
Christians, in various parts of the world, are closing their eyes
to sleep in Jesus. It has come home to our own business and bosoms.
It has chosen our houses to be the scene of its miracles. But
rarely does it fall to the lot of human eyes to witness so high a
display of its value and virtue, as was witnessed in that blessed
woman whose entrance into the joy of her Lord has occasioned our
assembling this evening.</p>
<!--Page 360--><a name="P360" id="P360"></a>
<p>"As we are commanded to be followers of them who through faith
and patience inherit the promises, we should have their example
before us, that we may learn to imbibe their spirit, to imitate
their graces, and be ready for their reward. With this view, permit
me to lay before you some brief recollections of our deceased
friend.</p>
<p>"It is not my intention to relate the history of her life. That
will be a proper task for biography. I design merely to state a few
leading facts, and to sketch such outlines of character as may show
to those who knew her not, what manner of person she was in all
holy conversation and godliness. Those who knew her best require no
such remembrancer, and will be able, from their own observation, to
supply its defects.</p>
<p>"I<font size="-1">SABELLA</font> M<font size=
"-1">ARSHALL</font>, known to us as Mrs. G<font size=
"-1">RAHAM</font>, received from nature qualities which, in
circumstances favorable to their development, do not allow their
possessor to pass through life unnoticed and inefficient.</p>
<p>"An intellect strong, prompt, and inquisitive &mdash; a temper
open, generous, cheerful, ardent &mdash; a heart replete with
tenderness, and alive to every social affection and every
benevolent impulse &mdash; a spirit at once enterprising and
persevering &mdash; the whole crowned with that rare and
inestimable endowment, good sense &mdash; were materials which
required only skilful management to fit her for adorning and
dignifying any female station. With that sort of cultivation which
the world most admires, and those opportunities which attend upon
rank and fortune, she might have shone in the circles of the great
without forfeiting <!--Page 361--><a name="P361" id="P361"></a>
the esteem of the good. Or had her lot fallen among the literary
unbelievers of the continent, she might have figured in the sphere
of the Voltaires, the Duffauds, and the other <i>esprits forts</i>
of Paris. She might have been as gay in public, as dismal in
private, and as wretched in her end, as any of the most
distinguished among them for their wit and their woe. But God had
destined her for other scenes and services &mdash; scenes from
which greatness turns away appalled, and services which all the
cohorts of infidel wit are unable to perform. She was to be
prepared by poverty, bereavement, and grief, to pity and to succor
the poor, the bereaved, and the grieving. The sorrows of widowhood
were to teach her the heart of the widow &mdash; her babes,
deprived of their father, to open the springs of her compassion to
the fatherless and orphan &mdash; and the consolations of God, her
refuge and strength, her very present help in trouble, to make her
a daughter of consolation to them who were walking in the valley of
the shadow of death.</p>
<p>"To train her betimes for the future dispensations of his
providence, the Lord touched the heart of this chosen vessel in her
early youth. The spirit of prayer sanctified her infant lips, and
taught her, as far back as her memory could go, to pour out her
heart before God. She had not reached her eleventh year when she
selected a bush in the retirement of the field, and there devoted
herself to her God by faith in the Redeemer. The incidents of her
education, thoughtless companions, the love of dress, and the
dancing-school, as she has herself recorded, chilled for a while
the warmth of her piety, and robbed her bosom of its peace. But her
gracious Lord revisited <!--Page 362--><a name="P362" id=
"P362"></a> her with his mercy, and bound her to himself in an
everlasting covenant, which she sealed at his own table about the
seventeenth year of her age.</p>
<p>"Having married, a few years after, Dr. John Graham, surgeon to
the 60th British regiment, she accompanied him first to Montreal,
and shortly after to Fort Niagara. Here, during four years of
temporal prosperity, she had no opportunity, even for once, of
entering the habitation of God's house, or hearing the sound of his
gospel. Secluded from the waters of the sanctuary and all the
public means of growth in grace, her religion began to languish and
its leaf to droop. But the root was perennial &mdash; it was of the
seed of God, which liveth and abideth for ever. The Sabbath was
still to her the sign of his covenant. On that day of rest, with
her Bible in her hand, she used to wander through the woods, renew
her self-dedication, and pour out her prayer for the salvation of
her husband and her children. He who 'dwelleth not in temples made
with hands,' heard her cry from the wilds of Niagara, and
strengthened her with strength in her soul.</p>
<p>"By one of those vicissitudes which checker military life, the
regiment was ordered to the island of Antigua in the West Indies.
Here she met with that exquisite enjoyment to which she had been
long a stranger &mdash; the communion of kindred spirits in the
love of Christ: and soon did she need all the soothing and support
which it is fitted to administer; for in a very short time the
husband of her youth, the object of her most devoted affection, her
sole earthly stay, was taken from her by death. The stroke was,
indeed, mitigated by the sweet assurance that he slept
<!--Page 363--><a name="P363" id="P363"></a> in Jesus. But a
heart like hers, convulsed by a review of the past and anticipation
of the future, would have burst with agony, had she not known how
to pour its sorrows into the bosom of her heavenly Father. Trials
which beat sense and reason to the ground, raise up the faith of
the Christian, and draw her closer to her God. O, how divine to
have him as the rock of our rest when every earthly reliance is a
broken reed.</p>
<p>"Bowing to his mysterious dispensation, and committing herself
to his protection as the Father of the fatherless and the Husband
of the widow, she returns with her charge to her native land, to
contract alliance with penury, and to live by faith for her daily
bread. That same grace under whose teaching she knew how to abound,
taught her also how to suffer need. With a dignity which belongs
only to them who have treasure in heaven, she descended to her
humble cot, employment, and fare. But her humility, according to
the Scripture, was the forerunner of her advancement. The light of
her virtues shone brightest in her obscurity, and pointed her way
to the confidential trust of forming the minds and manners of young
females of different ranks in the metropolis of Scotland. Here,
respected by the great and beloved by the good; in sacred intimacy
with 'devout and honorable women,' and the friendship of men who
were in truth servants of the most high God, she continued in the
successful discharge of her duties till Providence conducted her to
our shores.</p>
<p>"She long had a predilection for America, as a land in which,
according to her favorite opinion, the church of Christ is signally
to flourish. Here she <!--Page 364--><a name="P364" id=
"P364"></a> wished to end her days and leave her children. And
we shall remember with gratitude, that in granting her wish, God
cast her lot with ourselves. Twenty-five years ago she opened in
this city a school for the education of young ladies, the benefits
of which have been strongly felt, and will be long felt hereafter,
in different and distant parts of our country. Evidently devoted to
the welfare of her pupils &mdash; attentive to their peculiarities
of character &mdash; happy in discovering the best avenue of
approach to their minds &mdash; possessing in a high degree the
talent of simplifying her instruction and varying its form, she
succeeded in that most difficult part of a teacher's work, the
inducing youth to take an interest in their own improvement, and to
educate themselves by exerting their own faculties.</p>
<p>"In governing her little empire, she acted upon those principles
which are the basis of all good government, on every scale and
under every modification &mdash; to be reasonable, to be firm, and
to be uniform. Her authority was both tempered and strengthened by
condescension. It commanded respect while it conciliated affection.
Her word was law, but it was the law of kindness. It spoke to the
conscience, but it spoke to the heart; and obedience bowed with the
knee of love. She did not, however, imagine her work to be
perfected in fitting her &eacute;l&egrave;ves for duties and
elegance of life. Never did she forget their immortal nature.
Utterly devoid of sectarian narrowness, she labored to infuse into
their minds those vital principles of evangelical piety which form
the common distinction of the disciples of Christ, the peculiar
glory of the female name, and the surest <!--Page 365--><a name=
"P365" id="P365"></a> pledge of domestic bliss. Her voice, her
example, her prayers concurred in recommending that pure and
undefiled religion without which no human being shall see the Lord.
Shall we wonder that her scholars should be tenderly attached to
such a preceptress; that they should leave her with their tears and
their blessing; that they should carry an indelible remembrance of
her into the bosom of their families; that the reverence of pupils
should ripen with their years into the affection of friends; and
that there should be among them, at this day, many a wife who is a
crown to her husband, and many a mother who is a blessing to her
children, and who owes, in a great degree, the felicity of her
character to the impressions, the principles, and the habits which
she received while under the maternal tuition of Mrs. G<font size=
"-1">RAHAM</font>?</p>
<p>"Admonished at length by the infirmities of age, and importuned
by her friends, this venerable matron retired to private life. But
it was impossible for her to be idle. Her leisure only gave a new
direction to her activity. With no less alacrity than she had
displayed in the education of youth, did she now embark in the
relief of misery. Her benevolence was unbounded, but it was
discreet. There are charities which increase the wretchedness they
are designed to diminish; which, from some fatal defect in their
application, bribe to iniquity while they are relieving want, and
make food and raiment and clothing to warm into life the most
poisonous seeds of vice. But the charities of our departed friend
were of another order. They selected the fittest objects &mdash;
the widow, the fatherless, the orphan, the untaught child, and the
ignorant adult. They combined intellectual and
<!--Page 366--><a name="P366" id="P366"></a> moral benefit with
the communication of physical comfort.</p>
<p>"In her house originated the Society for the Relief of Poor
Widows with Small Children. Large, indeed, is this branch of the
family of affliction, and largely did it share in her sympathy and
succor. When at the head of this noble association, she made it her
business to see with her own eyes the objects of their care; and to
give, by her personal presence and efforts, the strongest impulse
to their humane system. From morning till night has she gone from
abode to abode of these destitute, who are too commonly unpitied by
the great, despised by the proud, and forgotten by the gay. She has
gone to sit beside them on their humble seat, hearing their simple
and sorrowful story, sharing their homely meal &mdash; ascertaining
the condition of their children &mdash; stirring them up to
diligence, to economy, to neatness, to order &mdash; putting them
into the way of obtaining suitable employment for themselves and
suitable places for their children &mdash; distributing among them
the word of God, and tracts calculated to familiarize its first
principles to their understanding &mdash; cherishing them in
sickness, admonishing them in health &mdash; instructing,
reproving, exhorting, consoling &mdash; sanctifying the whole with
fervent prayer. Many a sobbing heart and streaming eye is this
evening embalming her memory in the house of the widow.</p>
<p>"Little if any less is the debt due to her from that invaluable
charity, the Orphan Asylum. It speaks its own praise, and that
praise is hers. Scores of orphans redeemed from filth, from
ignorance, from wretchedness, from crime &mdash; clothed, fed,
instructed &mdash; trained <!--Page 367--><a name="P367" id=
"P367"></a> in cleanliness to habits of industry &mdash; early
imbued with the knowledge and fear of God &mdash; gradually
preparing for respectability, usefulness, and happiness, is a
spectacle for angels. Their infantine gayety, their healthful
sport, their cherub faces, mark the contrast between their present
and former condition; and recall very tenderly the scenes in which
they used to cluster round their patron-mother, hang on her
gracious words, and receive her benediction.</p>
<p>"Brethren, I am not dealing in romance, but in sober fact. The
night would be too short for a full enumeration of her worthy
deeds. Suffice it to say that they ended but with her life. The
Sabbath previous to her last sickness occupied her with a recent
institution &mdash; a Sunday-school for ignorant adults; and the
evening preceding the touch of death, found her at the side of a
faithful domestic, administering consolation to his wounded
spirit.</p>
<p>"Such active benevolence could hardly be detected in company
with a niggardly temper. Wishes which cost nothing; pity which
expires on the lips; be ye warmed and be ye clothed, from a cold
heart and an unyielding gripe, never imprinted their disgraceful
brand upon Isabella Graham. What she urged upon others she
exemplified in herself. She kept a purse for God. Here, in
obedience to his command, she deposited the first-fruits of all her
increase; and they were sacred to his service, as in his providence
he should call for them. No shuffling pretences, no pitiful
evasions, when a fair demand was made upon the hallowed store; and
no frigid affectation in determining the quality of the demand. A
sense of <!--Page 368--><a name="P368" id="P368"></a> duty was
the prompter, candor the interpreter, and good sense the judge. Her
disbursements were proportioned to the value of the object, and
were ready at a moment's warning, to the very last farthing.* How
pungent a reproof to those ladies of opulence and fashion who
sacrifice so largely to their dissipation or their vanity, that
they have nothing left for mouths without food, and limbs without
raiment! How far does it throw back into the shade those men of
prosperous enterprise and gilded state who, in the hope of some
additional lucre, have thousands and ten thousands at their beck;
but who, when asked for decent contributions to what they
themselves acknowledge to be all-important, turn away with this
hollow excuse, 'I cannot afford it.' Above all, how should her
example redden the faces of many who profess to belong to Christ;
to have received gratuitously from him what he procured for them at
the expense of his own blood, 'an inheritance incorruptible and
undefiled, and that fadeth not away;' and yet, in the midst of
abundance which he has lavished upon them, when the question is
about relieving his suffering members, or promoting the glory of
his kingdom, are sour, reluctant, mean. Are these the Christians?
Can it be that they have committed their bodies, their souls, their
eternal hope, to a Saviour whose thousand promises on this very
point of honoring him with their substance, have less influence
upon their hearts and their hands than the word of any honest man?
Remember the deceased, and hang your heads &mdash; remember
<!--Page 369--><a name="P369" id="P369"></a> her, and tremble;
remember her, and bring forth fruits meet for repentance.</p>
<p class="note">*The author knew her, when in moderate
circumstances, to give, unsolicited, <i>fifty pounds at once</i>
out of that sacred purse to a single most worthy purpose.</p>
<p>"In that charity, also, which far surpasses mere almsgiving,
however liberal, the charity of the gospel, our friend was
conspicuous. The love of God shed abroad in her own heart by the
Holy Ghost, drew forth her love to his people wherever she found
them. Assuredly she had in herself this witness of her having
'passed from death unto life,' that she loved the brethren. The
epistle, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living
God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshly tables of the heart;
yet read and known of all men: that is, the Christian temper
manifested by a Christian conversation, was to her the best letter
of recommendation. Unwavering in her own faith as to the peculiar
doctrines of the gospel, she could nevertheless extend love without
dissimulation, and the very bowels of Christian fellowship, to
others who, whatever might be their mistakes, their infirmities, or
their differences in smaller matters, agreed in the great Christian
essential of acceptance in the Beloved. Deeply did she deplore the
conceit, the bigotry, and the bitterness of sect. O that her spirit
were more prevalent in the churches; that we could labor to abase
our crown of pride; to offer up with one consent upon the altar of
evangelical charity, those petty jealousies, animosities, and
strifes which are our common reproach; and walk together as
children of the same Father, brethren of the same Redeemer, and
heirs of the same salvation.</p>
<p>"To these admirable traits of character were added great
tenderness of conscience and a spirit of prayer. Her religion, not
contented to justify her before men, <!--Page 370--><a name="P370"
id="P370"></a> habitually aimed at pleasing God, who looketh
upon the heart. It was not enough for her to persuade herself that
a thing might be right. Before venturing upon it, she studied to
reduce the question of right to a clear certainty. How cautious and
scrupulous and jealous of herself she was in this matter, they best
can tell who saw her in the shade of retirement as well as in the
sunshine of public observation. Perhaps it is not going too far to
say, that her least guarded moments would, in others, have been
marked for circumspection. At the same time her vigilance had
nothing austere, gloomy, constrained, or censorious &mdash; nothing
to repress the cheerfulness of social intercourse, or to excite in
others, even the thoughtless, a dread of merciless criticism after
they should retire. It was sanctified nature moving gracefully in
its own element. And with respect to the character and feelings of
her neighbors, she was too full of Christian kindness not to keep
her tongue from evil and her lips from speaking guile.</p>
<p>"These virtues and graces were maintained and invigorated by her
habit of prayer. With the 'new and living way into the holiest by
the blood of Jesus,' she was intimately familiar. Thither the
Spirit of grace and supplication daily conducted her; there taught
her to pray, and in praying to believe, and in believing to have
'fellowship with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ.' She
knew her God as the God that heareth prayer; and could attest that
'blessed is she that believeth, for there shall be a performance of
those things which were told her from the Lord.'</p>
<p>"Under such influence her course could not but be
<!--Page 371--><a name="P371" id="P371"></a> correct, and her
steps well ordered. The 'secret of the Lord is with them that fear
him; and he will show them his covenant, he will guide them in
judgment.' Thus he did with his handmaid whom he hath called home.
Wherever she was, and in whatever circumstances, she remembered the
guide of her youth, who, according to His promise, never left her,
nor forsook her; but continued His gracious presence with her when
she was old and gray-headed.</p>
<p>"You may perhaps imagine, that with such direction and support
it was impossible she should see trouble. Nay, but waters of a full
cup were wrung out to her. She often ate the bread of sorrow
steeped in wormwood and gall. Her heavenly Father showed her great
and sore adversities; that he might try her as silver is tried, and
bring her forth from the furnace purified seven times. It was
during these refining processes that she found the worth of being a
Christian. Though her way was planted with thorns and watered with
her tears, yet the candle of the Lord shone upon her head; and from
step to step she had reason to cry, Hitherto hath Jehovah
helped.</p>
<p>"In a word, like Enoch, she walked with God; like Abraham, she
staggered not at his promise through unbelief; like Jacob, she
wrestled with the angel and prevailed; like Moses, endured as
seeing Him who is invisible; like Paul, finished her course with
joy. Blessed were the eyes of the preacher, for they saw the
victory of her faith; and his ears, for they heard her song of
salvation. 'You can say with the apostle, I know whom I have
believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I
have committed unto him?' 'O yes, but I cannot say the
<!--Page 372--><a name="P372" id="P372"></a> other, I have
fought a good fight; I must say, I have fought a poor fight, I have
run a poor race; but Christ fought for me. Christ ran with me, and
through Christ I hope to win,' 'But you have no fear, no doubts,
about your going to be with Christ?' 'O no, not a doubt; I am as
sure of that as if I were already in my Saviour's arms.' It was her
final conversation with children of the dust. The next day, when
her flesh and her heart had so far failed that she was incapable of
uttering a sentence, she still proved her God to be the strength of
her heart, and knew him to be her portion for ever. I said to her,
'It is peace,' She opened her eyes, smiled, closed them again,
bowed her dying head, and breathed out, 'Peace,' It was her last
word on this side heaven. The attending spirits caught it from her
lips, and brought to her the next day permission to sleep in
Jesus.</p>
<p>"From this review allow me to urge the value of private
exertions in promoting general good.</p>
<p>"In pursuing his gratifications, man is apt to look upon himself
as a being of great importance; in fulfilling his duties, to
account himself as nothing. Both are extravagances which it will be
his wisdom and happiness to correct. He is neither supreme in worth
nor useless in action. Let him not say, 'I am but one; my voice
will be drowned in the universal din; my weight is lighter than a
feather in the public scale. It is better for me to mind my own
affairs, and leave these higher attempts to more competent hands.'
This is the language, not of reason and modesty, but of sloth, of
selfishness, and of pride. The amount of it is, 'I cannot do every
thing, therefore I will do nothing,' But you can do much. Act well
your part <!--Page 373--><a name="P373" id="P373"></a> according
to your faculties, your station, and your means. The result will be
honorable to yourself, delightful to your friends, and beneficial
to the world. I advise not to gigantic aims, to enormous
enterprise. The world has seen but one Newton, and one Howard.
Nothing is required of you but to make the most of the
opportunities within your reach.</p>
<p>"Recall the example of Mrs. Graham. Here was a woman, a widow, a
stranger in a strange land, without fortune, with no friends but
such as her letters of introduction and her worth should acquire,
and with a family of daughters dependent upon her for their
subsistence. Surely if any one has a clear title of immunity from
the obligation to carry her cares beyond the domestic circle, it is
this widow, it is this stranger. Yet within a few years this
stranger, this widow, with no means but her excellent sense, her
benevolent heart, and her persevering will to do good, awakens the
charities of a populous city, and gives to them an impulse, a
direction, and an efficacy unknown before.</p>
<p>"What might not be done by men &mdash; by men of talent, of
standing, of wealth, of leisure? How speedily, under their
well-directed beneficence, might a whole country change its
physical, intellectual, and moral aspect; and assume, comparatively
speaking, the face of another Eden, a second garden of God. Why
then do they not diffuse thus extensively the seeds of knowledge,
of virtue, and of bliss? I ask not for their pretences; they are as
old as the lust of lucre, and are refuted by the example which we
have been contemplating: I ask for the true reason, for the
inspiring principle of their conduct. It is this &mdash; let them
look to it when God shall call them to account
<!--Page 374--><a name="P374" id="P374"></a> for the abuse of
their time, their talents, their station, their 'unrighteous
mammon' &mdash; it is this: they believe not 'the words of the Lord
Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.'
They labor under no want but one, they want <i>the heart</i>. The
bountiful God add this to the other gifts which he has bestowed
upon them. I turn to the other sex.</p>
<p>"That venerable mother in Israel who has exchanged the service
of God on earth for his service in heaven, has left a legacy to her
sisters: she has left the example of her faith and patience; she
has left her prayers; she has left the monument of her Christian
deeds; and by these she being dead, yet speaketh. Matrons, has she
left her mantle also? Are there none among you to hear her voice
from the tomb, Go and do thou likewise? None whom affluence
permits, endowments qualify, and piety prompts, to aim at her
distinction by treading in her steps? Maidens, are there none among
you who would wish to array yourselves hereafter in the honors of
this virtuous woman? Your hearts have dismissed their wonted warmth
and generosity, if they do not throb as the revered vision rises
before you. Then prepare yourselves now, by seeking and serving the
God of her youth. You cannot be too early adorned with the robes of
righteousness and the garments of salvation in which she was
wedded, in her morning of life, to Jesus the King of glory. That
same grace which threw its radiance around her, shall make you also
to shine in the beauty of holiness; and the fragrance of those
virtues which it shall create, develope, and ennoble, will be 'as
the smell of a field which the Lord hath blessed.'</p>
<p>"Yea, let me press upon all the transcendent
<!--Page 375--><a name="P375" id="P375"></a> excellence of
Christian character, and the victorious power of Christian hope.
The former bears the image of God; the latter is as imperishable as
his throne. We fasten our eyes with more real respect and more
heart-felt approbation upon the moral majesty displayed in walking
as Christ also walked, than upon all the pomps of the monarch or
decorations of the military hero. More touching to the sense and
more grateful to high heaven is the soft melancholy with which we
look after our departed friend, and the tear which embalms her
memory, than the thundering plaudits which rend the air with the
name of a conqueror. She has obtained a triumph over that foe who
shall break the arm of valor, and strike off the crown of kings.
'The fashion of this world passeth away.' Old Time approaches
towards his last hour. The proudest memorials of human grandeur
shall be food for the conflagration to be kindled when 'the Lord
Jesus shall be revealed from heaven in flaming fire. Then shall he
be glorified in his saints, and admired in all them that
believe.'</p>
<p>"There are those perhaps, in the present assembly, who repute
godliness fanaticism, and the sobriety of Christian peace the gloom
of a joyless spirit; but who cannot forbear sighing out, with the
prophet of mammon, 'Let me die the death of the righteous, and let
my last end be like his.' If they proceed no further, their wish
will not be granted. None shall die the death of the righteous,
unless by a rare dispensation of mercy, who do not live his life.
They only are fit to be with God who love God and keep his
commandments. In that day of transport and of terror which we shall
all witness, how many of the thoughtless <!--Page 376--><a name=
"P376" id="P376"></a> fair who now 'sport themselves with their
own deceivings,' would give all the treasures of the east and
thrones of the west to sit with Isabella Graham on the right hand
of Jesus Christ. If ye be wise betimes, ye may. Now is the accepted
time; to-day is the day of salvation. The gospel of the Son of God
offers you at this very moment, the forgiveness of your sins, and
an inheritance among them that are sanctified. The blessing comes
to you as a free gift: accept it, and live; accept it, and be safe;
accept it, and put away the shudderings of guilt and the fear of
death. Then shall you too, like our friend, go in due season to be
with Christ. Your happy spirit shall rejoin hers in the mansions of
the saved. God shall bring you in soul and body with her when he
makes up his jewels. Then shall he gather his elect from the four
winds of heaven, shall perfect that which concerneth them, and make
them fully and for ever blessed. Be our place among them in that
day.'</p>

<h4>EXTRACT FROM MRS. GRAHAM'S LAST WILL AND&nbsp;TESTAMENT.</h4>
<p>"My children and my grandchildren I leave to my covenant God
&mdash; the God who hath fed me all my life with the bread that
perisheth, and the bread that never perisheth; who has been a
Father to my fatherless children, and a Husband to their widowed
mother thus far. And now, receiving my Redeemer's testimony,
John&nbsp;3:33, I set to my seal that God is true; and believing
the record in John's epistle, that God hath given to me eternal
life, and this life is in his Son, who, through the eternal Spirit,
offered himself without spot unto God, and being consecrated a
<!--Page 377--><a name="P377" id="P377"></a> priest for ever,
hath with his own blood, entered into the holy place, having
obtained eternal redemption for me. I also believe that he will
perfect what concerns me, support and carry me safely through
death, and present me to his Father, complete in his own
righteousness, without spot or wrinkle. Into the hands of this
redeeming God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, I commit my redeemed
spirit."</p>
<p>Mrs. Graham's epitaph on a tablet in the Pearl-street church, is
associated with that of her son-in-law Mr. Bethune, to whom before
his connection with the family she was a spiritual mother; who
prepared her memoir, wrote and printed tracts for her widows,
imported Bibles for her to distribute, replenished her charity
purse when exhausted; with whom she took sweet counsel and walked
to the house of God in company; and for whom she was pleased to
leave the written and honorable testimony: "He stands in my mind,
in temper, conduct, and conversation, the nearest to the gospel
standard of any man or woman I ever knew as intimately. Devoted to
his God, to his church, to his family, to all to whom he may have
opportunity of doing good, duty is his governing principle; cast
upon his care, under God he nourishes me with kindness," etc. They
have entered into rest. One sepulchre contains their sleeping dust,
and one monument bears the following tribute to their memory:</p>

<h3>PROVISION</h3>

<h3>PASSAGE OVER JORDAN.</h3>
<p class="note">*Found in Mrs. Graham's pocket after her
decease.</p>
<p>"'P<font size="-1">REPARE</font> you victuals, for within three
days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land
which the Lord your God giveth you to possess it. When ye see the
ark of the covenant of the Lord your God, and the priests bearing
it, then ye shall remove and go after it: that ye may know the way
by which ye must go, for ye have not passed this way
heretofore.'</p>
<p>"'Sanctify yourselves, for to-morrow the Lord will do wonders
among you.'</p>
<p>"'Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth
passeth over before you into Jordan: and it shall come to pass,
that as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the
ark of the Lord, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the
waters, that the waters of Jordan shall be cut off from the waters
that come down from above; and they shall stand upon a heap.'</p>
<p>"'And it came to pass, that when the people removed from their
tents to pass over Jordan, and the priests bearing the ark of the
covenant before the people, that as they that bare the ark were
come into Jordan, and the feet of the priests were dipped in the
<!--Page 380--><a name="P380" id="P380"></a> brim of the water,
that the waters that came down from above stood and rose up upon a
heap; and the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the Lord
stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the
Israelites passed over on dry ground.'</p>
<p>"'And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the
place where the feet of the priests that bare the ark of the
covenant of the Lord stood; and they are there unto this day.'</p>
<p>"'When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come,
saying, What mean these stones? ye shall let your children know,
saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land; for the Lord your
God dried up the waters from before you until ye were passed over,
as the Lord your God did to the Red sea, which he dried up, until
we were passed over; that all people of the earth might know the
hand of the Lord, that it is mighty: that ye might fear the Lord
your God for ever,' Amen. Josh.&nbsp;1:11;
chap.&nbsp;3,&nbsp;4.</p>
<p>"Oh, thou Jehovah; Israel's God, and by thy new covenant, my
God; thus far hast thou brought me through the wilderness: bearing,
chastising, forgiving, restoring. Well hast thou made out thy
wilderness name to me: 'The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and
gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth,
keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity, transgression, and
sin.' Great have been my provocations, but greater still thy
covenant mercy. I have not perished with them that believed not;
sore bitten I am, but thou hast fixed mine eyes on the lifted-up
Healer, and I am in his hand for further cure. My journey has been
long, and my way devious; but my blessed Joshua is still in view. I
must be near to <!--Page 381--><a name="P381" id="P381"></a>
Jordan's flood; I have been preparing victuals from thine own
repository of truth. And now, my blessed High-priest and Ark of the
covenant, lead on my staggering steps the little further. I have
not gone this way heretofore, but thou hast measured these waters
while they overflowed all their banks. Thou hast passed through,
and made the passage safe for thy people. At thy command the waters
stand up upon a heap, and they pass through in thy presence on
faith's firm ground. Keep then mine eye upon thee, and I shall fear
no evil. And Oh, my, blessed Leader, if it might please thee, I
would ask a boon, yet with submission, that thy sensible presence
might be with me all the way through; and that thou wouldst bring
from my quivering lips a testimony to the glory of thy grace, that
my children may know that thou hast pardoned, restored, perfected,
dried up the waters of terror, carried me triumphantly through, and
put me in possession of the purchased inheritance.&emsp;Amen.</p>
<p>"'This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that
Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am
chief.' chief.' 1&nbsp;Tim. 1:15.</p>
<p>"I have often inquired, What is there within us, or without us,
on which a sinner can rest in peace in a dying hour? If it be a
holy life, there can be no peace for me &mdash; taking the law of
God for my standard; backslider is my name; yet I think in this
sacred volume I find a hope even for me, the chief of sinners.</p>
<p>"'As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must
the Son of man be lifted up, that whosoever believeth on him should
not perish, but have eternal life. For God so loved the world, that
he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever
<!--Page 382--><a name="P382" id="P382"></a> believeth on him
should not perish, but have eternal life. For God sent not his Son
into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him
might be saved.' 'He that cometh from heaven is above all, and what
he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth.' 'He that receiveth his
testimony has set to his seal that God is true.' 'The Father loveth
the Son, and hath given all things into his hand; he that believeth
on the Son hath everlasting life.' John 3:14-36. Here is a hope for
me; the world is made up of sinners, I am one of them, and though
the chief, am not excluded. The Son of man came to save that which
was lost, Matt. 18:11; I am of that description. 'The Pharisees
said, Why eateth your master with publicans and sinners? Jesus
said, The whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.'
Matt. 9:11. I am a sinner, and sick. 'I will have mercy, and not
sacrifice; for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to
repentance.' I am a sinner, and need repentance. 'Him hath God
exalted with his right hand, to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give
repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins.' Acts 5:31. 'The Lord
is long-suffering, not willing that any should perish, but that all
should come to repentance.' 2&nbsp;Pet. 3:9.</p>
<p>"Christ said to the woman of Samaria, a notorious sinner, 'If
thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee,
Give me to drink, thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would
have given thee living water. Whosoever drinketh of this water
shall thirst again; but whosoever drinketh of the water that I
shall give him, shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give
him shall be in him a well of water springing
<!--Page 383--><a name="P383" id="P383"></a> up into everlasting
life.' John 4:10, 14. Yes, my Redeemer, a draught of this water,
received in faith from the hand of the Spirit, will give life in
death. O pour it into my thirsty soul in that searching hour.</p>
<p>"Jesus said to a mixed multitude of sinners like me, 'Labor not
for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto
everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you; for him
hath God the Father sealed,' John 6:27. These sinners said unto
him, 'What shall we do that we might work the works of God?' 'That
ye believe on Him whom he hath sent. My Father giveth you the true
bread from heaven, for the bread of God is he which cometh down
from heaven, and giveth life unto the world: I am the bread of
life; he that cometh unto me shall never hunger, and he that
believeth on me shall never thirst. I am the living bread which
came down from heaven; if any man eat of this bread, he shall live
for ever. And the bread which I shall give is my flesh, which I
will give for the life of the world. Jesus said unto them, Except
ye eat the flesh, and drink the blood of the Son of man, ye have no
life in you: whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth
in me, and I in him. As the living Father hath sent me, and I live
by the Father; so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.' The
Father giveth this bread, the Son giveth this bread; whosoever
will, may take of this bread, and the promise with it. Father, I
take this bread, I take and believe that I have in thee eternal
life, according to thy word. O holy and blessed Comforter, Spirit
of the Father and of the Son, whose office it is to take of the
things of Christ and show them unto his redeemed, when the bread
and the <!--Page 384--><a name="P384" id="P384"></a> water that
perish can no longer refresh this dying body, apply this living
bread and living water to my soul, that life may spring up in the
midst of death; and in that trying hour, bear witness with my
spirit that I dwell in Christ, and Christ in me, and that I shall
never die.</p>
<p>"'In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and
cried, If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink. He that
believeth on me, as the Scripture hath said, out of his belly shall
flow rivers of living water. This spake he of the Spirit, that they
who believe on him should receive.' John 7:37. This he proclaimed
to a mixed multitude of sinners like myself. Lord, I believe, and
am sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God. Be it
unto me according to thy word: 'I am the resurrection and the life:
he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live;
and whosoever liveth and believeth in me, shall never die.
Believest thou this?' John 11:25. I believe that thou art the
Christ, the Son of the living God, which should come into the
world; the promised Messiah; the gift of the Father, the covenant
given to the people; the anointed Prophet and King, and consecrated
High-priest; who through the eternal Spirit offeredst thyself
without spot unto God; who came to do that most perfect will of
God, by which we are sanctified through the offering of the body of
Christ once for all. Lamb of God, which takest away the sins of the
world, on thee I lay my precious never-dying soul; wash me in thy
blood, clothe me in thy righteousness; sanctify me, soul, spirit,
and body, to thy service. I have no other foundation of hope,
nothing within me, nothing without me; my entire dependence
<!--Page 385--><a name="P385" id="P385"></a> is on thy finished
work; into thy hands I commit my spirit.</p>
<p>"Let me hear thy consoling voice, compassionate Saviour. 'Let
not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me.
In my Father's house are many mansions; if it were not so I would
have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. I will come again
and receive you unto myself, that where I am, there ye may be
also,' John 14:1-3. O seal this upon my heart, and it is enough. To
be where thou art, is heaven enough to me. To be where thou art, to
see thee as thou art, and to be made like thee, the last sinful
motion for ever past &mdash; no more opposition, no more weariness,
listlessness, dryness, deadness; but conformed to my blessed Head,
every way capacitated to serve him, and to enjoy him &mdash; this
is heaven.</p>
<p>"'Jesus said, I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no man
cometh to the Father, but by me.' Blessed Comforter, do thine
office; take these things of Christ and show them unto me; lead me
in this way, feed me with this truth, and animate me with this
life: 'Whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, that will
I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If ye ask any
thing in my name, I will do it.' Blessed Comforter, here also do
thine office: I know not what to ask for as I ought; help mine
infirmities as thou hast said; suggest the prayer, be in me the
spirit of prayer and supplication, and especially in that hour of
need, when sickness saps the clay tabernacle, discomposing the
spirit, and confusing perhaps the ideas: still, still let my
thoughts rise to my God. Oh, let no unhallowed subject get hold of
me in that hour, but keep my Saviour's name in my heart, and on my
lips. <!--Page 386--><a name="P386" id="P386"></a> Is not this
according to thy will? watch over it then, and keep the avenues of
my soul from every vain idea.</p>
<p>"'If ye love me, keep my commandments, and I will pray the
Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide
with you for ever, even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot
receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him; but ye know
him, for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. He that hath my
commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me; and he that
loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and
will manifest myself unto him; and we will come and make our abode
with him. The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father
will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all
things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you. Peace
I leave with you; my peace I give unto you; not as the world
giveth, give I unto you: let not your heart be troubled, neither
let it be afraid.' In that last warfare, when nothing on earth can
give peace; when the world recedes, and disappears; when friends
must stand aloof and leave me to the combat alone; Oh, blessed and
promised Comforter, bring to my remembrance, and impress on my
weary spirit these sweet words of my Saviour. But it has often
occurred to me, and may in that hour, that though Jesus received
sinners, they were ignorant sinners. The Jews understood not the
gospel contained in their types and sacrifices; they were
unenlightened and unconverted; the Gentiles were totally blind,
serving dumb idols; neither had known the gospel, neither had
tasted the grace of God, neither were backsliders, like me. I have
known the truth, been enlightened, tasted of the
<!--Page 387--><a name="P387" id="P387"></a> heavenly gift, been
made a partaker of the Holy Ghost, tasted of the good word of God,
and of the power of the world to come.</p>
<p>"Fifty years ago the Lord convinced me of my sin, my misery, and
my total helplessness. I was also, I think, enabled to lay hold on
the hope set before me.</p>
<p>"I have, in numerous exercises and acts, accepted of God's gift
of Jesus Christ to me a condemned sinner; taking hold of the
Scripture words of invitation and promise held out for my
acceptance. I have pleaded his own covenant provision, in the
substitution of his own Son in my stead, making him to be sin, who
knew no sin, that sinners might be made the righteousness of God in
him. I put in my claim as a sinner, among the ungodly for whom
Christ died. I believed his testimony, and set to my seal that God
is true. I rested on this foundation &mdash; I yet have no other; I
know there is no other. The foundation standeth sure. But Oh, what
am I to think of the fruits? I have again and again turned back
into the world, grieved the Spirit, crucified the Son of God
afresh, and put him to open shame. No wonder I stand alarmed at the
apostle's assertion: my conscience testifies that my character is
nearly, if not altogether, such as the apostle, by the Holy Spirit,
says it is impossible to renew to repentance. Hebrews 6:4, 5. But
thou hast renewed to repentance! Thy name is 'the Lord, the Lord
God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in
goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving
iniquity, transgression, and sin.' Thou wilt by no means clear the
guilty; but thou hast provided a substitute, and laid my guilt and
guilty person on thine own Son.</p>
<!--Page 388--><a name="P388" id="P388"></a>
<p>"By this gracious name thou wast known to thy backsliding Israel
in the wilderness; whose heart, like mine, was not right with God;
neither were they steadfast in his covenant; but he, 'being full of
compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not.' Many a
time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.
They forgot God their Saviour, who had done great things for them;
they transgressed his commandment, and in their heart turned back
again to Egypt; they brought upon themselves many afflictions, and
many times did he deliver them; they provoked him with their
counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity; nevertheless, he
heard their cry, and repented according to the multitude of his
mercies; while the blood of bulls and of goats typified the great
propitiatory sacrifice, by which 'God can be just and justify the
ungodly.' By this name was the Lord God, merciful and gracious,
known in the pleasant land; and by the same sacrifice, the blood of
Christ, which cleanseth from all sin, was typified. Psalms
103,&nbsp;51.</p>
<p>"The prophets prophesied in his name. 'All we, like sheep, have
gone astray, and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.
He was wounded for our transgressions, and bruised for our
iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was laid on him, and by
his stripes we are healed.' 'Deliver him from going down to the
pit; I have found a ransom.' Even backsliders, among whom I stand
chief, have been recalled. 'My people have committed two evils:
they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters, and have hewn
out to themselves cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no
water. Is Israel a servant; is he a home-born slave; wherefore is
he spoiled? Hast thou not procured <!--Page 389--><a name="P389"
id="P389"></a> this to thyself, in that thou hast forsaken the
Lord thy God, when he led thee by the way? And now what hast thou
to do in the way of Egypt, to drink the waters of Sihor? or what
hast thou to do in the way of Assyria, to drink the waters of the
river? Thine own wickedness shall correct thee, and thy
backslidings shall reprove thee. Know therefore, and see that it is
an evil and bitter thing, that thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God,
and that my fear is not in thee, saith the Lord God of hosts. For
of old I have broken thy yoke, and burst thy bands; and thou
saidst, I will not transgress; when upon every high hill and under
every green tree thou wanderest, playing the harlot. Yet I had
planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how art thou turned
into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me? Why gaddest
thou about so much to change thy way? thou also shalt be ashamed of
Egypt, as thou wast ashamed of Assyria. Have I been a barren
wilderness, or a land of darkness unto thee? Wherefore say my
people, We are lords, and will come no more to thee? Can a maid
forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? yet my people have
forgotten me, days without number.' Jeremiah&nbsp;2. 'They say, If
a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become another
man's, shall he return to her again? shall not that land be greatly
polluted? But thou hast played the harlot with many lovers; yet
return again unto me, saith the Lord. Wilt thou not from this time
cry unto me. My Father, thou art the guide of my youth?' What can I
say to such grace? Thou art infinite in thy mercy to pardon, and in
thy power to save. Such has been my character, and such the amazing
mercy of my offended God. <!--Page 390--><a name="P390" id=
"P390"></a> Often, often has he pardoned, restored, blessed, and
made me happy. But Oh, just is the renewed charge against me. 'For
the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very
treacherously with me, saith the Lord. They have belied the Lord,
and said, It is not he, neither shall evil come upon us.' 'Go and
proclaim these words, and say, Return, thou backsliding Israel,
saith the Lord; and I will not cause mine anger to fall upon you:
for I am merciful, saith the Lord, I will not keep anger for ever.
Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast transgressed
against the Lord thy God; and ye have not obeyed my voice, saith
the Lord. Turn, O backsliding children, for I am married unto you.'
Jer.&nbsp;3. What, O what can I say to such grace? Truly, thy ways
are not as our ways, nor thy thoughts as our thoughts. For as the
heavens are higher than the earth, so are thy ways higher than our
ways, and thy thoughts than our thoughts. Oh, how is my guilt
aggravated by all this grace; and yet thou callest, <i>Return;</i>
and thou thyself turnest me. I do, O Lord God, merciful and
gracious, I do acknowledge my iniquity; every time I turn back my
eyes upon my past life my sins rise in magnitude, heightened by
more enlarged views of thy goodness. It is of the Lord's mercies
that I am not consumed, because his compassions fail not.</p>
<p>"A voice was heard upon the high places, weeping and
supplication of the children of Israel, for they have perverted
their ways, and they have forgotten the Lord their God. Yes, thou
hast, my gracious God, granted repentance. Thine eye has seen the
tears I have shed; thou hast given me a contrite heart. I have
looked upon him whom I have pierced, and <!--Page 391--><a name=
"P391" id="P391"></a> been in bitterness as for a first-born. I
feel it now, and must feel it while the body of sin exists. But Oh,
Lord God, merciful and gracious, the cause is in thyself, that I
hear thy voice, and that I answer. 'Return, ye backsliding
children, and I will heal your backslidings. Behold, I come unto
thee, for thou art the Lord our God. Truly in vain is salvation
hoped for from the hills and the multitude of mountains. Truly, in
the Lord God is the salvation of Israel. We lie down in our shame,
our confusion covereth us: for we have sinned against the Lord our
God; we and our fathers, even from our youth; and have not obeyed
the voice of the Lord God. Thus saith the Lord God, I will even
deal with thee as thou hast done, who hast despised the oath in
breaking the covenant. Nevertheless, I will remember my covenant
with thee in the days of thy youth; and I will establish unto thee
an everlasting covenant, and thou shalt know that I am the Lord.
That thou mayest remember and be confounded, and never open thy
mouth any more, because of thy shame, when I am pacified towards
thee, saith the Lord God.' Amen, Lord God, merciful and gracious.
Be it so. It is so <i>now</i> &mdash; it <i>must</i>, it will be
so, until death shall open mine eyes on that mystery: The glory of
God arising out of the abounding of sin, through the superabounding
of grace, and grace reigning through righteousness unto eternal
life, by Jesus Christ our Lord!</p>
<p>"Till then, while sin dwelleth in me, let me enjoy the
blessedness of a contrite heart; yea, even shame and confusion,
since it is the sign that thou art pacified with me. Thou hast
dealt with me, thou hast chastened, and in some instances taken

inventions. But thou art pacified with me, and I dare look again to
thy holy temple, to the temple not made with hands, to the minister
of the sanctuary, and the true tabernacle which the Lord pitched,
and not man; to the blessed High-priest, who through the eternal
Spirit offered himself a sacrifice without spot unto God, and by
his own blood entered in once into the holy place, having obtained
eternal redemption for us, and when he had purged our sins, sat
down on the right hand of the Majesty on high; to the blessed
Mediator of the new and better covenant, established on better
promises; to the Surety of the new testament, and sealed with his
own blood. Oh, I will look unto Jesus, the object, the author, and
the finisher of that faith which interests us in himself and the
whole of his purchase. He bids me look unto him, and be saved. I do
look unto him, and I am saved. Who dares condemn the sinner whom
Christ acquits? Who shall lay any thing to his charge? 'It is
Christ that died; yea, rather, who is risen again; who is even at
the right hand of God; who also maketh intercession for us.'"</p>

passed over from my God? Hast thou not <!--Page 397--><a name=

everlasting God fainteth not, neither is weary? there is no
searching of his understanding. He giveth power to the faint; and
to them that have no might he increaseth strength. Even the youths
shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall; but
they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall
mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary;
they shall walk, and not faint.' Isa. 40:11,&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>"'Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? Did not
the Lord, he against whom we have sinned? For they would not walk
in his ways, neither were they obedient to his law. Therefore he
hath poured upon him the fury of his anger, and the strength of
battle: and it hath set him on fire round about, yet he knew not;
and it burned him, yet he laid it not to heart. But now thus saith
the Lord that created thee, O Jacob, and he that formed thee, O
Israel, Fear not; for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by
thy name; thou art mine. When thou passest through the waters, I
will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow
thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burnt;
neither shall the flame kindle upon thee. For I am the Lord thy
God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour. Since thou wast precious
in my sight thou hast been honorable, and I have loved thee.' Isa.

thy name. 'I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy
transgressions, and as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I
have redeemed thee. Sing, O ye heavens; for the Lord hath done it:
shout, ye lower parts of the earth: break forth into singing, ye
mountains, O forest and every green tree therein; for the Lord hath
redeemed Jacob, and glorified himself in Israel.'</p>
<p>"'For if by one man's offence, death reigned by one; much more
they which receive abundance of grace, and of the gift of
righteousness, shall reign in life by one, Christ Jesus. Where sin
abounded, grace did much more abound: that as sin hath reigned unto
death, so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal
life, by Jesus Christ our Lord.'</p>
<p>"'Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for
I am God, and there is none else. I have sworn by myself, the word
is gone out of my mouth in righteousness, and shall not return,
that unto me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear. Surely
shall one say, In the Lord have I righteousness and strength: even
to him shall men come; and all that are incensed against him shall
be ashamed. In the Lord shall all the seed of Israel be justified,
and shall glory.' 'Hearken unto me, O house of Jacob, and all the
remnant of the house of Israel. Even to your old age, I am he; and
even to hoar hairs will I carry you: I have made, and I will bear;
even I will carry, and will deliver you.' Isa.

<p>"'Thus saith the Lord; I, even I, will both search my sheep, and
seek them out. As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that
he is among his sheep <!--Page 399--><a name="P399" id=
"P399"></a> that are scattered; so will I seek out my sheep, and
will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered
in the cloudy and dark day. And I will bring them out from the
people, and gather them to their own land, and feed them upon the
mountains of Israel by the rivers, and in all the inhabited places
of the country. And I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon
the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be: there shall they
lie in a good fold, and in a fat pasture shall they feed upon the
mountains of Israel. I will feed my flock, and I will cause them to
lie down, saith the Lord God. I will seek that which was lost, and
bring again that which was driven away, and will bind up that which
was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick.' Ezek. 34:11.
He hath done it, I am his witness: I, the poor wanderer, the happy
subject of this grace. 'And I will raise up for them a plant of
renown,' my Jesus, 'and they shall be no 'more consumed with hunger
in the land, neither bear the shame of the heathen any more. Thus
shall they know that I the Lord their God am with them, and that
they, even the house of Israel, are my people, saith the Lord God.
And ye my flock, the flock of my pasture, are men, and I am your
God, saith the Lord God.' Ezek. 34:29. 'As the mountains are round
about Jerusalem, so the Lord is round about his people from
henceforth, even for ever.' Psa.&nbsp;125:2.</p>
<p>"'When the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled
it by their own way and by their doings. And I scattered them among
the heathen, and they were dispersed through the countries;
according to their ways and according to their doings I judged
them. And when they entered unto the heathen,
<!--Page 400--><a name="P400" id="P400"></a> whither they went,
they profaned my holy name, when they said to them, These are the
people of the Lord, and are gone forth out of his land. But I had
pity for my holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among
the heathen, whither they went. Therefore say unto the house of
Israel, thus saith the Lord God: I do not this for your sakes, O
house of Israel, but for my holy name's sake, which ye have
profaned among the heathen, whither ye went. And I will sanctify my
great name, which was profaned among the heathen, which ye have
profaned in the midst of them; and the heathen shall know that I am
the Lord, saith the Lord God, when I shall be sanctified in you
before their eyes. For I will take you from among the heathen, and
gather you out of all countries, and will bring you into your own
land. Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be
clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I
cleanse you. A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit
will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of
your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh. And I will put my
Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye
shall keep my judgments, and do them. I will also save you from all
your uncleannesses: and I will call for the corn, and will increase
it, and lay no famine upon you. And I will multiply the fruit of
the tree, and the increase of the field, that ye shall receive no
more reproach of famine among the heathen. Then shall ye remember
your own evil ways, and your doings that were not good, and shall
loathe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities, and for
your abominations. Not for your sakes do I this, saith the
<!--Page 401--><a name="P401" id="P401"></a> Lord God, be it

they are life.' John 6:51,&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>"'For of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us
wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption.'
1&nbsp;Cor. 1:30.</p>
<p>"'Seeing then that we have a great High-priest, who is passed
into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our
profession. For we have not a High-priest who cannot be touched
with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted
like as we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore come boldly unto
the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to
help in time of need.' Heb. 4:14. 'For this is the covenant that I
will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the
Lord: I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their
hearts; and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a
people: and they shall not teach every man his neighbor, and every
man his brother, saying, Know the Lord; for all shall know me, from
the least to the greatest. For I will be merciful to their
unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I
remember no more. In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made
the first old. Now that <!--Page 407--><a name="P407" id=
"P407"></a> which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish
away.' Heb. 8:10-13.</p>
<p>"'This is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life,
and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he
that hath not the Son of God, hath not life.' 1&nbsp;John
5:11,&nbsp;12. Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift.'
2&nbsp;Cor. 9:15.</p>
<p>"'Truly my soul waiteth upon God; from him cometh my salvation.
He is my defence; I shall not be greatly moved. My soul, wait thou
only upon God, for my expectation is from him: he only is my rock
and my salvation; he is my defence; I shall not be moved. In God is
my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, and my refuge
is in God.' Psa. 62:1-7."</p>

<h4>REST.</h4>
<p>"'Thus the heavens and the earth were finished: and on the
seventh day God ended his work which he had made, and he rested the
seventh day from all his work which he had made; and God blessed
the seventh day, and sanctified it, because that in it he had
rested from all his work that he had created and made.' Genesis
2:1-3.</p>
<p>"'And Moses said, To-morrow is the rest of the holy Sabbath unto
the Lord. So the people rested on the seventh day.' Exodus 16:23,
30.</p>
<p>"'And the women followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and
how his body was laid. And they returned, and prepared spices and
ointments; and rested the Sabbath day according to the
commandment.' Luke 23:55,&nbsp;56.</p>
<!--Page 408--><a name="P408" id="P408"></a>
<p>"Christ rested in the tomb of Joseph the last Sabbath under the
law; but the evening and the morning were the first day. On that
morning he closed his work of humiliation, manifested his victory
over death &mdash; the curse denounced &mdash; by rising from the
tomb, and rested on the first day of the week from all his
humiliation work; his death, burial, and rest in the grave on the
seventh day being the last part of that work."</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
